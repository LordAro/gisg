<m|chael> Wow. I found code (in C) that finds the maximum of 3 variables with only six comparisons! :P

<yakk> ahh, of course
<m|chael> maxfd is used only for the first arg to select()
<yakk> select *bad*
<yakk> poll *good*
* m|chael nods vigorously.
<yakk> /dev/poll *better*
<m|chael> But I don't have time to fix this.
* yakk nods.
<yakk> know that feeling
<m|chael> But I do have time to update my vent page at http://quota2.murdoch.edu.au/shame.html ;)
<yakk> m|chael: what are you doing at murdoch? programming? sysadmining?
<m|chael> 'Unix Support Officer'
<m|chael> Mostly adminning.
<m|chael> But I have this heap-of-shit RedHate box used for web proxy and student byte-counting.
<m|chael> kernel 2.3.29 (hacked), squid 2.2.STABLE4 (hacked), tac_plus (hacked)
<m|chael> When Adrian gets back from Sydney I'm going to get work to pay him to get the squid hacks added to upstream.

> this assumes adrian does come back from sydney :P
<dayta> he was due back start of this week...
* dayta ponders
<yakk> m|chael: cool
* m|chael grins at trs80.
> yes, he was. current estimate involving a date is another month. but he also said "I don't know when I'm coming back" when I talked to him yesterday
<yakk> whats adrian doing in sydney?
<yakk> isn't he studying?
>  quota and proxy service FOO | BAR | green
> yakk: he's withdrawing
<yakk> again? :)
<m|chael> He -was-, presumably up until someone offered him dumptrucks full of money :P
<yakk> heh
<yakk> whats he doing in sydney?
<m|chael> trs80: Oi! That pages isn't really live yet :P
* m|chael wonders if/when /dev/netfilter_ipv4 went away.
> yakk: ISP stuff. he said before he went "6.5 figure salary", but I'm not sure if that's for what he's doing now or not.
* m|chael faints.
<Barnes> 6.5? Wouldn't that be halfway between a 6 figure and a 7 figure salary? I really don't think he's getting that much.
<m|chael> 10^(6.5-1)?
<grahame> gah
16:00

<grahame> damn them

<grahame> man SQL sucks
<grahame> it's just difficult to do so many simple things
<m|chael> Sounds like tcsh. :P
* acolyte peers at grahame 
<acolyte> easy to do simple things
<acolyte> its just things are often not simple 
<acolyte> databases in general suck
16:15

<dayta> hey dunc.
<dunc_> heyhey
* dayta found an electronic burr grinder :)
<shig> explodingdog is funny
<dunc_> ooo
<dunc_> cool
<dayta> last one  in the store :)
<dunc_> I got a pepper grinder for my birthday, and thought about trying coffee beans in one :-}
* dayta grins
<dayta> I have no use for my old manual one now :)
<dayta> the new one's _so_ much faster :P
<dayta> you just select fineness, press a button, and it does it :)
<dunc_> cool
<dunc_> how much?
* dayta can't seem to find anywhere to download blakes' seven movies.
<dayta> $135
<dayta> the woman I bought it off seemed doubtful she'd be able to find another one for some reason.
<dayta> it's by breville though, so I figure it'd be quite easy to get a random electronics store to order one in.
* dayta shrugs
<dayta> perhaps it doesn't work like that
<dunc_> probably does.
<dunc_> should be able to buy one /somewhere/.
* dayta nods
<dunc_> but I need money first
<dayta> yeah :)
<dayta> I've _almost_paid off my credit card :P
<dunc_> coffee maker second
<dayta> by then I should be able to tell you if it's gonna fall apart or not
<dunc_> and coffee beans third
21:15
<dunc_> I'm not minding the instant at the moment.  but I know I will as soon as I smell fresh grounds again.
<dayta> yes :)
<dayta> had a conversation with the girl in the store about that ;)
<dayta> got it from a place in that little arcade just north of subi train station...
<dayta> specialises in coffee, some random kitchen equipment, and drinking paraphernalia ;)
<dayta> almost ended up with martini glasses too :P
21:30
<dunc_> Melissa gave me the F1 2001 PS2 game for my birthday dayta ... apparently after you saying it was probably OK? :-)
<dayta> I think my response was actually 'Yeah, looks like it doesn't completely suck' I just read a few reviews of it :P
<dayta> she'd already bought it at the point she asked me ;)
<dunc_> oh
<dunc_> she didn't mention that bit, conveniently.
<dayta> I'm like "I don't want to answer these questions dammit :P"
<dayta> what's it like anyhow?
<dunc_> well, I thought I remembered seeing the preview with you on one of those magazine cover DVD's and us lambasting it to all hell.
<dayta> oh, entirely possible. I don't really remember names though :P
<dunc_> I played it a little bit, not as bad as I expected.
<dunc_> a bit like MotoGP, except in F1 cars and a lot more polished.
<dayta> reviews I read said it had a pretty good 'full season' type game.
<dunc_> yeah, I don't know that I can be bothered though.
<dayta> bah!
<dayta> (says the guy who hasn't played a game on his ps2 in multiple weeks)
<dunc_> I'm not into the whole realism thing, just want to grab a car and race.  Surprisingly, I was able to do that.
<dayta> cool ;)
<dayta> and... f1... 
<dunc_> I raced around Suzuka because it's familiar territory :-)
<dayta> good impression of speed? :)
* dayta rofls
<dayta> does it drive similarly in an f1 car?
<dayta> how do your lap times compare?
<dunc_> heheh
<dunc_> didn't get that far.  haven't actually played motoGP since I got it from you.
<dunc_> it does drive similarly.
<dayta> nah, you'd kindaq played it out ;)
<dunc_> much easier to brake for corners in the F1 car.
<dunc_> oh, and you can actually steer under brakes, I think that makes most of the difference - don't actually need to set up for corners as much.
* dayta grins
<dayta> indeed. I need a roadgoing f1 car :)
<dayta> then I need roads that are flat enough.
<dayta> bugger this 6 seconds to 100 thing. 
<dunc_> that's what this game is - F1 cars which don't shatter when you hit the walls.
<dunc_> dude my bike is faster than that.
<Barnes> Can you jack other peoples F1 cars?
<dunc_> hey barnes.
<dayta> dunc: of course it is, that's _my_ car :P
<Barnes> Hey hey.
<dunc_> doubt it, but I'll try :-)
<dayta> I shoulda told her to try and find a copy of gta3 actually.. it doesn't matter that you've played itbefore ;)
<dunc_> yup
<dunc_> when I checked recently, gta3 was still in the top ten.
21:45
<dunc_> I'm enjoying ICO a lot.
<dunc_> there have been a couple of times where I've been really frustrated and about to give up when I see the answer.
<dunc_> fuck, ps2 games are selling for up to $81 on ebay.  that's > 80% of retail :-/
* dayta grins
<dayta> yeah, finish ico so I can borrow it ;)
<dunc_> pfeh
<dunc_> it looks pretty long.
<dunc_> but we will see
<dayta> ps2 games are outselling xbox by about 3:1 at the moment.
<dayta> yeah, interesting you say that ;) since the reviews I said didn't agree.
<dayta> btw, did you get the dvd remote with it?
<dunc_> I rainchecked a package at target which included a remote.  so no, not yet.
<dunc_> but no the sony remote, in case you wanted the dvd driver update.
<dunc_> Tekken 4
<dunc_> Tekken 4 marks the return of Namco's premier fighting franchise. Tekken strikes back with new jaw-dropping graphics, game play mechanics, and fearsome fighters.
<dunc_> oops
<dunc_> apparently GTA: Vice City will be out end of october.
<dayta> yeah, i'll be getting it :)
<dayta> I need to get hold of the dvd-driver update at some point.
<dayta> might bug teik about it again.
<dunc_> do you have problems playing dvd's?
<dayta> the sound gets out of sync lots.
<dayta> haven;'t had any issues with them actually _playing_, but better quality would be nice :P
* dayta ponders
<dayta> though, I could probly write my own by now :)
<dunc_> driver?
<dunc_> I'm sick, so bed time.  ciao.

<yakk> is it about dwarves?

<dayta> he is.
<dayta> and I always kinda like books that feel like australia
<yakk> yeah
<yakk> I know what you mean
<dayta> I think australian culture (as in, aboriginal culture I guess) is under-represented.
* yakk nods.
<yakk> "modern" australian culture is pretty unique too
<dayta> theres a lot of original stuff there, untapped :)
