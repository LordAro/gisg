[31 Dec/12:12] <LosGuy> hmm
[31 Dec/12:12] <LosGuy> do you have any other ISPs?
[31 Dec/12:12] <Catfish45> It always does it on those same programs?
[31 Dec/12:12] <DaRkThInG> what happens?
[31 Dec/12:12] <LosGuy> possibly infected with a trojan?
[31 Dec/12:12] <LosGuy> only happens when your online?
[31 Dec/12:13] <DaRkThInG> the connection here is still sucking..
[31 Dec/12:14] <nhobody> agg, sorry losguy
[31 Dec/12:15] <DaRkThInG> i've got the winsock.dll and wsock32.dll files out of the cabs, i've slowed the speed down, i shut ip header compression off (didn't work so it is back on)
[31 Dec/12:15] <nhobody> its when i setup aol, netzero or look at my modem preferances, maybe its my mode,
[31 Dec/12:15] <DaRkThInG> i've swapped cards around
[31 Dec/12:15] <DaRkThInG> checked for line noise it seems to be alright..

[31 Dec/12:16] <LosGuy> that could be net congestion even DaRkThInG

[31 Dec/12:17] <nhobody> how do i correct this problem?
[31 Dec/12:18] <LosGuy> DaRkThInG try 56K.com 
[31 Dec/12:18] <DaRkThInG> this isn't just slowing down...a complete halt..pages aren't available that where..irc connection drops..that sort of thing
[31 Dec/12:18] <DaRkThInG> somtimes the entire connection goes

[31 Dec/12:21] <LosGuy> look at yer tracert and see if you can see where
[31 Dec/12:22] <LosGuy> DaRkThInG but that is due to your route... a backbone might be dropping packets etc

[31 Dec/12:25] <DaRkThInG> hah tried that..
[31 Dec/12:25] <DaRkThInG> all they say is line noise
[31 Dec/12:25] <DaRkThInG> and they told me to check it..
[31 Dec/12:25] <LosGuy> I have yet to see an ISP take credit for problems)
[31 Dec/12:25] <DaRkThInG> i will have the phone company check the line on monday given the phones work..
[31 Dec/12:26] <LosGuy> phones working and them being able to carry data are two different things
[31 Dec/12:26] <DaRkThInG> would a bad modem cause a prob like that?

[31 Dec/12:29] <LosGuy> tell them yer having trouble faxing
[31 Dec/12:29] <DaRkThInG> so you don't think the modem could be on the fritz?
[31 Dec/12:29] <LosGuy> (they dont care about your internet usually)

Sadly, Farris is convinced he'll be slain this year--as one of the Two Witnesses mentioned in the Book of Revelation, this is his fated role.

[31 Dec/18:45] <Big`Ed> this site - has several utilities on the bottom
[31 Dec/18:45] <Big`Ed> one is SYSINFO
[31 Dec/18:45] <Big`Ed> it reads the drive make / model
[31 Dec/18:45] <Big`Ed> one is MAXDIAG
[31 Dec/18:45] <Big`Ed> to test the drive
[31 Dec/18:46] <Big`Ed> one is MUD - that has both of these files
[31 Dec/18:46] <Big`Ed> if drive is 'detected' by SYSINFO/MAXDIAG
[31 Dec/18:46] <Big`Ed> you can then use 'maxblast' and install it

[31 Dec/19:52] <BelieveIt> i just wondered if anyone really knew the meaning of some of these codes...guess not huh?

[31 Dec/19:54] <BelieveIt> LosGuy...would you explain what 56k.com is?  and my modem is not a 56k...does that matter?
[31 Dec/19:54] <LosGuy> BelieveIt I belive 56k.com has the modem string info you want do I want to try to interperet your log? no
[31 Dec/19:54] <LosGuy> no
[31 Dec/19:54] <BelieveIt> lol
[31 Dec/19:55] <BelieveIt> or even your own log?
[31 Dec/19:55] <BelieveIt> have you ever?
[31 Dec/19:55] <walkndude> Smokee didn't Big Ed go through this already with you?
[31 Dec/19:55] <LosGuy> those are just codes that mean things to your modem ie connedt what protocol to use how the negotiations went on the connection and eventually probably the hang up 
[31 Dec/19:55] <Smokee> yeah, but his plan didn't work
[31 Dec/19:56] <Smokee> got to http://www.nstor.com/genesis_s/segment1/techinfo/disk/data_sheets/MAXTOR.7245/MAXTOR.7245_1.html
[31 Dec/19:56] <BelieveIt> i think i was able to determine those LosGuy...it was the other I was intrigued by!
[31 Dec/19:56] <walkndude> http://web.aimnet.com/~jnavas/modem/faq.html
[31 Dec/19:56] <Smokee> and look at the picture...where do i want my jumper so it will be slave
[31 Dec/19:56] <walkndude> try there too BelieveIt
[31 Dec/19:56] <BelieveIt> nope
[31 Dec/19:57] <BelieveIt> not until you tell me why i should
[31 Dec/19:57] <LosGuy> BelieveIt ... I dont even know what info it was you found so interesting
[31 Dec/19:57] <BelieveIt> i go nowhere unless i know why I should
[31 Dec/19:57] <LosGuy> then dont
[31 Dec/19:57] <whizd> hard case
[31 Dec/19:57] <BelieveIt> won't
[31 Dec/19:57] <BelieveIt> not really
[31 Dec/19:58] <BelieveIt> just wondered if anyone has been able to interpret the codes found here and was expecting a no {i haven't tried} or yes I have and understand them...would have liked to learn about this coding!  That simple!

[31 Dec/20:12] <LosGuy> sheez I have seen this somewhere before uni and it had to do with it not liking a certain IRQ (or requiring it) but I dont remember where I saw it
[31 Dec/20:13] <LosGuy> is it PCI or ISA?
[31 Dec/20:13] <uni> ias
[31 Dec/20:13] <uni> isa
[31 Dec/20:13] <LosGuy> then find the IRQ you want and reserve it in bios?
[31 Dec/20:13] <uni> like what should i try
[31 Dec/20:13] <uni> like 7 or 9?
[31 Dec/20:14] <LosGuy> aztech should have the info you want on their site (but I seem to remember 9 being the cause of the problem)
[31 Dec/20:14] <uni> if i double click on the speaker icon next to like task scheduler and stuff....it shows that the wav....is being in use
[31 Dec/20:16] <walkndude> might be a device driver update for the MB (IRQ routing) that may help?
[31 Dec/20:16] <uni> does aztech have a web site to get drivers?

[31 Dec/20:21] <uni> im trying to find some drivers for it now on there site
[31 Dec/20:22] <LosGuy> uni walkndude was refering to your mb as the problem when he said drivers (not that deleting it and reinstalling drivers (most recent) might not help)
[31 Dec/20:22] <LosGuy> and check out the manual too they have one in .pdf

[01 Jan/06:05] <Flinston3> if u could please help me

[01 Jan/06:06] <Big`Ed> Flinston3 - depends
[01 Jan/06:06] <Big`Ed> what is the system?
[01 Jan/06:06] <Flinston3> win98
[01 Jan/06:06] <Elysian> i'm having troubles with the win98 comp recognizing this comp as a ICS server...
[01 Jan/06:07] <Big`Ed> rtc is a bios clock problem
[01 Jan/06:07] <Flinston3> oh
[01 Jan/06:07] <Big`Ed> Elysian - is ics setup right?
[01 Jan/06:07] <Big`Ed> did the y2k scanner give any advice?
[01 Jan/06:07] <Elysian> i guess
[01 Jan/06:07] <Elysian> it looked right
[01 Jan/06:08] <Elysian> it also told me it made this comp a ip over the network of 192.168.0.1
[01 Jan/06:08] <Big`Ed> correct
[01 Jan/06:08] <Big`Ed> reboot master?
[01 Jan/06:09] <Big`Ed> Flinston3 - http://www.ais.columbia.edu/y2k/html/bios_fix.html
[01 Jan/06:09] <Big`Ed> Several manufacturers are providing BIOS upgrades for the time clock (CMOS RTC or Real Time Clock) on their PCs. Do not attempt this solution unless you are confident about your computer skills. If you turn off the machine while you are installing the upgrade, you can render the PC completely unusable
[01 Jan/06:10] <Big`Ed> Flinston3 - option #1 - is to get the BIOS updated
[01 Jan/06:10] * Elysian hates windows 2k... can't update my bios:(
[01 Jan/06:10] <Flinston3> oh
[01 Jan/06:10] <Big`Ed> option #2 is this link to a software fix
[01 Jan/06:11] <Flinston3> okie
[01 Jan/06:11] <Flinston3> thx
[01 Jan/06:11] <Flinston3> =o)
[01 Jan/06:12] <Big`Ed> actually - that was a university site - so the software there is not downloadable
[01 Jan/06:12] <Elysian> whats ami bios's home page?
[01 Jan/06:12] <Flinston3> he wants to know how to update the bios (option #1)
[01 Jan/06:12] <Elysian> never mind
[01 Jan/06:12] <Elysian> found it
[01 Jan/06:13] <Big`Ed> what is his Motherboard and model # ?
[01 Jan/06:13] <Flinston3> wait
[01 Jan/06:13] <Big`Ed> like:  asus p2b
[01 Jan/06:13] <Flinston3> which is the easy one? the link u gave me?
[01 Jan/06:13] <Big`Ed> http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/downloads/swlib/swcol.y2k.html
[01 Jan/06:13] <Big`Ed> has a link to the software fix
[01 Jan/06:14] <Flinston3> so
[01 Jan/06:14] <Big`Ed> the BEST way is the bios fix
[01 Jan/06:14] <Flinston3> i should
[01 Jan/06:14] <Flinston3> go to this link
[01 Jan/06:14] <Flinston3> okie
[01 Jan/06:14] <Flinston3> any risks?
[01 Jan/06:14] <Big`Ed> ACCUTE-DATE Year 2000 Fix v1.0
[01 Jan/06:14] <Big`Ed> Make your real-time clock Y2K-compliant
[01 Jan/06:14] <Big`Ed> if you do not know how to update - yes
[01 Jan/06:14] <Big`Ed> a computer shop will do it for a small fee
[01 Jan/06:15] <Flinston3> oh
[01 Jan/06:15] <Big`Ed> it is not hard - but as with any change, there is a risk for the inexperienced
[01 Jan/06:15] <Flinston3> ok
[01 Jan/06:15] <Flinston3> thx
[01 Jan/06:15] <Flinston3> i guess
[01 Jan/06:15] <Flinston3> he won't be able to himself
[01 Jan/06:16] <Big`Ed> then use that software patch for now
[01 Jan/06:16] <Big`Ed> and plan to take it in to someone
[01 Jan/06:16] <Flinston3> uhmm
[01 Jan/06:16] <Big`Ed> or have a geek come over for a favor
[01 Jan/06:16] <Flinston3> software patch?

[01 Jan/06:16] <Flinston3> i installed
[01 Jan/06:16] <Big`Ed> fixes the RTC error
[01 Jan/06:16] <Flinston3> a y2k patch
[01 Jan/06:16] <Flinston3> i found
[01 Jan/06:16] <Flinston3> at download.com
[01 Jan/06:16] <Flinston3> says it's from microsoft
[01 Jan/06:17] <Flinston3> what does it exactly do?
[01 Jan/06:17] <Big`Ed> microsoft does not release any RTC software
[01 Jan/06:17] <Flinston3> i mean this should have been for something else then
[01 Jan/06:17] <Flinston3> np thx =o)
[01 Jan/06:17] <Big`Ed> the RTC software needs to run in the 'autoexec.bat' file and start everytime the pc-turns on
[01 Jan/06:17] <Big`Ed> to fix the clock
[01 Jan/06:17] <Flinston3> oh
[01 Jan/06:17] <Big`Ed> your on win98 right?
[01 Jan/06:18] <Flinston3> yup

[01 Jan/11:46] <tranced> how would i change a 4meg PCI viddy card to a 16meg AGP?
[01 Jan/11:46] <Big`Ed> did you buy a new card?
[01 Jan/11:47] <tranced> do i have to go into the BIOS and tell cpu to recognize AGP as viddy?
[01 Jan/11:47] <LosGuy> install a 16meg agp
[01 Jan/11:47] <tranced> erm...
[01 Jan/11:47] <tranced> yeah, i got one
[01 Jan/11:47] <tranced> but like...
[01 Jan/11:47] <Big`Ed> should almost be automatic, out with the old, in with the new
[01 Jan/11:47] <tranced> wot if i pull out the 4meg PCI and install the AGP and i get no viddy?
[01 Jan/11:47] <tranced> pnp eh?
[01 Jan/11:47] <Big`Ed> than there must be a bios setting
[01 Jan/11:47] <JCJC> I have a philips scsi writable CDrom that worked on my Dell pentium Pro.  I installed it on my new Micron mahine running Win98 and now I can't see it. 
[01 Jan/11:47] <Big`Ed> for agp
[01 Jan/11:48] <tranced> erm...
[01 Jan/11:48] <Big`Ed> jcjc - do you have the scsi drivers for it?
[01 Jan/11:48] <tranced> yeah see...i havent tried it yet
[01 Jan/11:48] <Big`Ed> jcjc - did you do a add/remove hardware ?
[01 Jan/11:48] <JCJC> Big Ed.  I assumed Win98 would find it? and install drivers, or tell me it doesn't have any.
[01 Jan/11:49] <tranced> i was talking to this techie at the puter store and he said there was a BIOS setting for it
[01 Jan/11:49] <LosGuy> probably tranced.. depends on your bios
[01 Jan/11:49] <JCJC> Big Ed, I did the add/remvoe but no luck.
[01 Jan/11:49] <tranced> would i have to start up w/ my PCI, change the BIOS, shut down and then install the AGP?
[01 Jan/11:49] > WarnBufet!tomorrow@208.148.73.233 has joined #win98
[01 Jan/11:49] <Big`Ed> tranced - every bios is different
[01 Jan/11:49] <Big`Ed> yes
[01 Jan/11:49] <tranced> erm...
[01 Jan/11:49] <tranced> demn
[01 Jan/11:49] <JCJC> At one point it was visible and worked and then I had to reboot and its gone,
[01 Jan/11:49] <Big`Ed> could be mb jumper
[01 Jan/11:50] <tranced> cuz im not at the puter im gonna do at
[01 Jan/11:50] <Big`Ed> jcjc - did you answer my questions?
[01 Jan/11:50] <tranced> biged: what's ur question?
[01 Jan/11:50] <Big`Ed> tranced - if you boot and get no video, there is some conflict - or phisical jumper
[01 Jan/11:50] <tranced> well i havent tried to upgrade yet
[01 Jan/11:50] <tranced> i jus wanna be informed
[01 Jan/11:50] <Big`Ed> should be pnp easy
[01 Jan/11:51] <tranced> it's spelled physical btw
[01 Jan/11:51] <tranced> great
[01 Jan/11:51] <tranced> i hope so
[01 Jan/11:51] <JCJC> Big ed, I tried add remove, no work, it did work once and I could read from it but then I rebooted and it is not present
[01 Jan/11:51] <Big`Ed> jcjc - check control panel, system, devices and look for the device with a !
[01 Jan/11:51] <tranced> another question i have is: if i have a 17" inch monitor and a 16meg AGP viddy card, will i be able to get 1600x1200 rez?
[01 Jan/11:51] <tranced> ! = conflict
[01 Jan/11:52] <Big`Ed> tranced - thats up to your video card/monitor
[01 Jan/11:52] ! DaSnake is known as Snake|y2k
[01 Jan/11:52] <Big`Ed> older 17"'s did not allways do 1600
[01 Jan/11:52] <JCJC> I looked under control panel system and the cdrom is not listed and there are no conflicts
[01 Jan/11:52] ! kill_ is known as kill`
[01 Jan/11:52] <tranced> well this is a new 17"
[01 Jan/11:52] <tranced> what does the rez depend on?
[01 Jan/11:53] <tranced> the combo of the monitor and card?
[01 Jan/11:53] <Big`Ed> jcjc - and if you do a add/remove again
[01 Jan/11:53] <JCJC> Big Ed, there are no conflicts anywhere on the machine
[01 Jan/11:53] <Big`Ed> tranced - yes
[01 Jan/11:53] <Azmodan> well and the amount of ram on the card
[01 Jan/11:53] <Azmodan> thats the deciding factor
[01 Jan/11:53] <JCJC> I tried the add/remove several times but it never finds anything.
[01 Jan/11:53] <tranced> yeah
[01 Jan/11:53] <tranced> so a new 17" monitor and a 16meg card will PROLLY give me 1600x1200 rez?
[01 Jan/11:54] <Big`Ed> jcjc - perhaps the wire came loose then, or the physical drive went bad?
[01 Jan/11:54] <Azmodan> if the rez is in the cards specifications
[01 Jan/11:54] <JCJC> Big Ed I wonder if I am  missing a driver or the SCSI chain is messed up
[01 Jan/11:54] <tranced> the same monitor w/ a 4meg PCI gives me 1280xwhatever rez
[01 Jan/11:54] <Big`Ed> JCJC - ALA wire
[01 Jan/11:54] <Big`Ed> jcjc - do you see the scsi card detect on boot?
[01 Jan/11:54] <Big`Ed> jcjc - and should be able to test it at lowlevel

[01 Jan/11:55] <tranced> i got a 16meg AGP for 45bux!
[01 Jan/11:55] <Big`Ed> jcjc - if it don't detect - prob a problem in the chain then
[01 Jan/11:56] ! antiowned is known as anti
[01 Jan/11:56] <CJ^> yo
[01 Jan/11:56] <tranced> so should i jus try to install the card pnp w/o messing w/ the BIOS, see if it werks, and then do the BIOS setting?
[01 Jan/11:56] <Big`Ed> yes
[01 Jan/11:56] <tranced> k, thas wot ill do then
[01 Jan/11:56] <Big`Ed> if no work , then back up and try again

[01 Jan/16:06] <SmokEe> a cable between the 2 pcs
[01 Jan/16:06] <Zeus> cable - as in tv cable?

[01 Jan/16:08] <SmokEe> what do i need to use?

[01 Jan/16:08] <LosGuy> how about with something like laplink
[01 Jan/16:08] <CJ^> LLpro may
[01 Jan/16:09] <CJ^> but it still needs the correct serial cable...

[01 Jan/17:17] <Deanajb> and you want to know the lines that it says there?
[01 Jan/17:18] <Los`Guy> rem = remark

[01 Jan/17:19] <Los`Guy> what does it say on the first line?

[01 Jan/17:20] <Deanajb> so i put that there then what?
[01 Jan/17:21] <Los`Guy> CJ^ do you know if that drive REQUIRES that drivers load from the config.sys? (and autoexec)
[01 Jan/17:21] <CJ^> no
[01 Jan/17:21] <CJ^> it doesnt
[01 Jan/17:21] <CJ^> BUT
[01 Jan/17:21] <Deanajb> i have no idea
[01 Jan/17:21] <CJ^> i know for a fact that most of them
[01 Jan/17:22] <CJ^> arent found by the win98 boot disk
[01 Jan/17:22] <CJ^> and its smattering of drivers that are industry standard
[01 Jan/17:22] ! bijzonder is known as bijshower
[01 Jan/17:22] <CJ^> and they are no on the WHQL list for a very good reason
[01 Jan/17:22] <Deanajb> so put it there , save, hook it back up and see what happens?
[01 Jan/17:23] <CJ^> ive seen thier CDRW drives here sell for less that $85
[01 Jan/17:23] <Deanajb> it was given to me 
[01 Jan/17:23] <Los`Guy> what is line 2 Deanajb?
[01 Jan/17:23] <Deanajb> #2 is buffershigh=150
[01 Jan/17:24] <Deanajb> #3 is fileshigh=100
[01 Jan/17:24] <CJ^> hmm..
[01 Jan/17:24] <Deanajb> #4 is DEVICE=C:\CDPRO\VIDE-CDD.SYS /D:MSCD001
[01 Jan/17:24] <CJ^> it put in DOS crud...
[01 Jan/17:24] <Los`Guy> rem that also
[01 Jan/17:24] <Deanajb> that #4 i think is for the cdrw
[01 Jan/17:24] <CJ^> im sure ya can rem all that out...
[01 Jan/17:24] <Deanajb> the first three i think were there from my cd rom
[01 Jan/17:24] <Los`Guy> the other might be required if you have some programs..ie compilers
[01 Jan/17:25] <CJ^> well you dont need an dos drivers for the cdrom or cdrw in win9x
[01 Jan/17:25] <Los`Guy> these two are Probably old...but might be needed for some programs:
[01 Jan/17:25] <Los`Guy> [20:23] <Deanajb> #2 is buffershigh=150
[01 Jan/17:25] <Los`Guy> [20:24] <Deanajb> #3 is fileshigh=100
[01 Jan/17:25] <CJ^> hmm...  i dunno...

[01 Jan/18:18] <LosGuy> doh itself
[01 Jan/18:18] <Adio-> when win98 starts up it goes it can't find the file..
[01 Jan/18:19] <Adio-> is it possible that there is still something telling win98 to start up the trojan on startup?
[01 Jan/18:19] <Elysian> yep
[01 Jan/18:19] <Adio-> where would that be?
[01 Jan/18:19] <Elysian> is this before win98 comes up into the GUI?
[01 Jan/18:19] <Adio-> no
[01 Jan/18:19] <Elysian> or is it when the microsoft windows 98 logo is on the screen
[01 Jan/18:19] <Adio-> this is in the gui
[01 Jan/18:20] <Elysian> ?
[01 Jan/18:20] <Elysian> ok
[01 Jan/18:20] <Adio-> no
[01 Jan/18:20] <Elysian> then run msconfig
[01 Jan/18:20] <Adio-> its when i have the start bar thing on the bottom of the screen
[01 Jan/18:20] <Elysian> run msconfig
[01 Jan/18:20] <Adio-> i have..
[01 Jan/18:20] <Elysian> mrsexe.exe? i'm gonna search AVP for that

[01 Jan/18:20] <Elysian> go to the startup tab
[01 Jan/18:20] <Adio-> avp found it

[01 Jan/18:21] <Elysian> and unclick it
[01 Jan/18:21] <Elysian> then click ok

[01 Jan/20:38] <Nig> Everytime I log into windows, my computer tries to dial out to the internet.  How can I turn that off?
[01 Jan/20:38] <LosGuy> Nig in control panel / internet tell it you connect via a lan
[01 Jan/20:38] <LosGuy> or actually
[01 Jan/20:39] <LosGuy> just take widows update out of task manager
[01 Jan/20:39] <Nig> I want it to connect when I run explorer, I just don't want it to do it every time I log in.
[01 Jan/20:39] <Nig> Task manager, or task scheduler?
[01 Jan/20:40] <LosGuy> doh yeah scheduler
[01 Jan/20:40] <LosGuy> that is a common cause of that
[01 Jan/20:40] <Nig> I don't have the scheduler running.
[01 Jan/20:41] <LosGuy> then do the first thing that I suggested cept you will have to connect via dialup networking shortcut 
[01 Jan/20:41] <Batman> why wouldn't anyone help me??
[01 Jan/20:41] * LosGuy dont do 3.1 or laplink
[01 Jan/20:41] <Nig> I have also checked the run and run services under both local machine and current user in the registry, as well as checking startup, and nothing I can find should be trying to hit the internet.
[01 Jan/20:42] <LosGuy> Nig annoyances.org has info on your problem

[01 Jan/20:43] <LosGuy> get that info?
[01 Jan/20:43] <LosGuy> is that all you need is info?
[01 Jan/20:44] <LosGuy> why not slave the HD
[01 Jan/20:44] <Batman> some huge files...
[01 Jan/20:44] <Batman> do what?
[01 Jan/20:45] <LosGuy> take the HD outof the computer you run win3.1 on .. set the jumper to slave and then put it in your win98 box, detecte it and you should see it as ie D: on your win98 box
[01 Jan/20:45] <LosGuy> you will be able to copy your large files much faster that way
[01 Jan/20:45] <LosGuy> (detect means detect it in bios)
[01 Jan/20:46] <Batman> when i installed the old hard drive into the new pc, I had a problem. On 3.1 the hd is c: & D: drive. I got the C: drive, but i need the info on the d:
[01 Jan/20:47] <Batman> I checked fdisk on the 3.1
[01 Jan/20:47] <Batman> but I'm not to familiar with it

[01 Jan/21:40] <Dmonn> what is the min. HDD size you need to install Win 98
[01 Jan/21:40] <Dmonn> ?
[01 Jan/21:41] <LosGuy> depends on what you install but the exact specs are on your cdrom (install.txt I belive)
[01 Jan/21:59] <Dmonn> well i was asking because i just saw a laptop being sold with win 98 in it and only a 250Mb HD and i find that hard to imagine, because i have tried to install it on a 400MB HD and during setup it stops me and says that i need 6xxMB free space, so i was just wondering if there are versions that can be used on smaller drives

[02 Jan/02:17] <pantherp> 7.200 RPS
[02 Jan/02:17] <pantherp> but it doesn't seem that fast
[02 Jan/02:17] <CJ^> so...
[02 Jan/02:17] <CJ^> not a win98 issue...
[02 Jan/02:18] <pantherp> any ideas?
[02 Jan/02:18] <CJ^> none..
[02 Jan/02:18] <CJ^> its not an OS issue
[02 Jan/02:18] <CJ^> i have a 7200rpm drive...
[02 Jan/02:18] <CJ^> seems fine to me..
[02 Jan/02:18] <pantherp> u see..when i play games
[02 Jan/02:18] <pantherp> it oftens loads
[02 Jan/02:18] <pantherp> thus slows down the game
[02 Jan/02:19] <CJ^> well.. the parger the drive.. and the larger the partiton.. that can sometimes cause it to act slow...
[02 Jan/02:20] <pantherp> well..it's split into 2 particions of 10 gigas each
[02 Jan/02:20] <CJ^> well still...  its nto going to be a screamer...
[02 Jan/02:20] <CJ^> IDE can only really be so fast...
[02 Jan/02:21] <CJ^> its the BUS its on...
[02 Jan/02:21] <pantherp> will udma66 make any difference?
[02 Jan/02:21] <CJ^> none that i have seen...
[02 Jan/02:21] <CJ^> not even with a UDMA 66 controller..
[02 Jan/02:22] <pantherp> i've seen faster ide harddisks
[02 Jan/02:22] <pantherp> and seagate claims that this one is the fastest
[02 Jan/02:22] <CJ^> IDE is all basically the same
[02 Jan/02:22] <CJ^> 7200 rpm drives area bit faster 
[02 Jan/02:23] <CJ^> but not lightening
[02 Jan/02:23] <pantherp> and it's making that anoying noice every time it loads
[02 Jan/02:23] <CJ^> what noise?
[02 Jan/02:24] <pantherp> like..every time it starts windows
[02 Jan/02:24] <pantherp> it's so noisy
[02 Jan/02:24] <CJ^> some drives are loud  
[02 Jan/02:24] <CJ^> some are quiet...
[02 Jan/02:24] <CJ^> its not an OS issue though...
[02 Jan/02:25] <pantherp> well...does the udma box do any difference?
[02 Jan/02:25] <pantherp> i have it checked
[02 Jan/02:25] <CJ^> no..
[02 Jan/02:26] <pantherp> but i haven't noticed any
[02 Jan/02:26] <CJ^> it doesnt speed up anything

[02 Jan/02:27] <pantherp> well..i am using an asus m/b with a p3-500 mhz 
[02 Jan/02:27] <pantherp> how comes and i get slowdowns?
[02 Jan/02:27] <CJ^> maybe the hard drive needs to be defragged...

[02 Jan/05:09] <Squid> ahh ok.. thanks :)
[02 Jan/05:09] <CJ^> but if the card is in PnP mode  you may need to take it out of PnP mode..

[02 Jan/11:01] <ebahnx> Every time I try to shut down, I get an error message saying that there is a problem with my taskmon.exe.  How do i fix this?
[02 Jan/11:01] <CJ^> run SFC
[02 Jan/11:01] <CJ^> see if its corrupted..
[02 Jan/11:02] <ebahnx> SFC?
[02 Jan/11:02] <w98> SFC is probably system file checker
[02 Jan/11:02] <ebahnx> yeah, I've done that already, but everything seemed fine.
[02 Jan/11:03] <CJ^> ok
[02 Jan/11:03] <CJ^> when did it all start?
[02 Jan/11:03] <ebahnx> I'd say a few months ago
[02 Jan/11:04] <CJ^> ok...
[02 Jan/11:04] <CJ^> and is this a home built system?
[02 Jan/11:04] <ebahnx> Windows runs okay, but every time I shut down, this message shows up

[02 Jan/12:46] <ThAmsTeR> yep.
[02 Jan/12:46] <mrgone> k send the 48x back and ask for a new 48x, its their fault if they want to upgrade your computer for free :)
[02 Jan/12:47] <pyrokiwi> lol yeh

[02 Jan/13:29] ! sistinas is known as osbourne
[02 Jan/13:29] <w98> rumour has it a simm is (Single In-Line Memory Module) Those little memory cards we're used to putting into a computer as memory. It used to be that you needed eight or nine single chips to put into a computer to make a whole memory unit. Now a single card or two is what's needed
[02 Jan/13:29] <RnDezZzzz> what's the difference ? 
[02 Jan/13:29] <Azmodan> what is a dimm
[02 Jan/13:29] <w98> it has been said that a dimm is (Dual In-Line Memory Module) Very much like a SIMM except that they are larger and you need only one in place of two SIMMs. DIMMs are 64-bit memory devices, so you just need a single DIMM for a processer with a 64-bit memory path to work properly. DIMMs are becoming more and more popular.

[02 Jan/17:06] <King_TJ> Hello....
[02 Jan/17:06] <King_TJ> Actually, I just came in here 'cuz I have a quick question. Looking for a Hayes ESP accelerator driver for '98....
[02 Jan/17:07] <King_TJ> Since Hayes went backrupt a while back, looks like the drivers are nowhere to be found anymore and I lost my disk for mine.
[02 Jan/17:07] <pyrokiwi> www.windrivers.com
[02 Jan/17:07] <CJ^> www.windrivers.com
[02 Jan/17:07] <pyrokiwi> lol i betya to it
[02 Jan/17:07] <King_TJ> I tried windrivers .... and it sucked. Just pointed me to www.hayes.com
[02 Jan/17:07] <CJ^> but........ being that Hayes is no longer in action  who knows if its available...
[02 Jan/17:08] <pyrokiwi> www.driverguide.com BUT use ie to go there
[02 Jan/17:08] <pyrokiwi> also login-drivers password-all
[02 Jan/17:08] <King_TJ> Hmm.... ok. Might try that.
[02 Jan/17:08] <Big`Ed> pyrokiwi - is that a legal site?

[02 Jan/17:51] <Elysian> you can't
[02 Jan/17:51] <Elysian> they are incompatible
[02 Jan/17:52] <pyrokiwi> do u mean as in 2 moniters?
[02 Jan/17:52] <Boney> R U sure
[02 Jan/17:52] <Boney> no 
[02 Jan/17:52] <Boney> I want both card to run on my computer using only one montier
[02 Jan/17:52] <Elysian> if you had voodoo2's then they would work but other than that it is practically impossible
[02 Jan/17:52] <pyrokiwi> nope voodoo3 doesnt need it
[02 Jan/17:53] <FultarX> yo elysian
[02 Jan/17:53] <FultarX> that flash screwed up my board
[02 Jan/17:53] <FultarX> won't boot any more
[02 Jan/17:53] <Elysian> really?
[02 Jan/17:53] <pyrokiwi> yeh i hate flash
[02 Jan/17:53] <Elysian> thats messed up
[02 Jan/17:53] <Elysian> what you should do
[02 Jan/17:53] <Elysian> there is a jumper on your motherboard to reset the cmos
[02 Jan/17:53] <Elysian> i think that could possibly help
[02 Jan/17:54] <Boney> some one said that it will work but I need a little program
[02 Jan/17:54] <Elysian> boney: never heard of such a program
[02 Jan/17:54] <FultarX> what will it reset thought...
[02 Jan/17:54] <CJafk> why use 2 2d/3d cards in one system
[02 Jan/17:54] <Boney> no that will not help because U reprogramed the bios
[02 Jan/17:54] <FultarX> will it go back to the original??
[02 Jan/17:54] <FultarX> yeah that is what I thought
[02 Jan/17:54] <CJafk> didnt know thay the VD3 3000 was pci either...
[02 Jan/17:54] <Elysian> but if you could write one then send it to me cause i gotta couple of incompatible cards i wanna bind!:)
[02 Jan/17:55] <FultarX> that is if you forget your password
[02 Jan/17:55] <Elysian> fultar: dunno but it is your only chance that i know of
[02 Jan/17:55] <Elysian> cj: v3's are pci and agp

[02 Jan/17:55] <pyrokiwi> hmmm i think unless u hav remoovable bios ur whole mb may be scrapped
[02 Jan/17:55] <Elysian> yeah
[02 Jan/17:55] <Elysian> thats what i said
[02 Jan/17:56] <Elysian> but if you are like me with only pci and isa, then you'd be happy:)

[02 Jan/18:07] <Boney> can I use tyhe viper with the voodoo 3 2000???
[02 Jan/18:07] <Elysian> i thought it was a 300
[02 Jan/18:07] <CJafk> NO
[02 Jan/18:07] <Boney> just wonding
[02 Jan/18:07] <CJafk> no...
[02 Jan/18:07] <Elysian> 3000
[02 Jan/18:07] <CJafk> look  
[02 Jan/18:07] <Azmodan> getting multi monitor to work with pci and agp combos is difficult
[02 Jan/18:07] <CJafk> both cards are 2d/3d
[02 Jan/18:07] <Elysian> no kidding
[02 Jan/18:07] <CJafk> well  thats easier than what he wants to do...
[02 Jan/18:07] <Elysian> i had a tough enough time with 2 pci
[02 Jan/18:07] <Azmodan> yeah
[02 Jan/18:07] <Boney> I just want to use one moniter
[02 Jan/18:08] <CJafk> Boney  no
[02 Jan/18:08] <Azmodan> boney, then you only need the voodoo
[02 Jan/18:08] <CJafk> ya cant do that...
[02 Jan/18:08] <CJafk> not that way
[02 Jan/18:08] <Elysian> 2 s3 virge identical cards and it didn't work!!!!
[02 Jan/18:08] <CJafk> stick with one card...
[02 Jan/18:08] <CJafk> or  go multimon...
[02 Jan/18:08] ! ^KiwiDude is known as KD-Away
[02 Jan/18:08] <Boney> how much is voodoo 2
[02 Jan/18:08] <Elysian> nothing ever showed up ont he second monitor
[02 Jan/18:08] <Elysian> :(
[02 Jan/18:08] <Elysian> it said it worked and i could movce stuff there, but no can do!
[02 Jan/18:08] <CJafk> VD2 is cheap
[02 Jan/18:08] <CJafk> but  why bother?
[02 Jan/18:08] <CJafk> ya got a VD 3
[02 Jan/18:09] <CJafk> use it
[02 Jan/18:09] <Elysian> no kidding
[02 Jan/18:09] <Boney> I used two moniter but I just only want to use one moniter
[02 Jan/18:09] <CJafk> oe send it to me...
[02 Jan/18:09] <CJafk> ill send ya a vd2
[02 Jan/18:09] <CJafk> Boney   this isnt a 2d card witha  3d card..
[02 Jan/18:09] <CJafk> its two 2d/3d cards...
[02 Jan/18:09] <CJafk> you cant link the two on one monitor...
[02 Jan/18:10] <Azmodan> Boney, take the viper out and put it in a box to gather cobwebs
[02 Jan/18:10] <Elysian> or send it to me!:)
[02 Jan/18:10] <Azmodan> Boney, you only need to use the voodoo3 card.  It combines both 2d and 3d in the same card
[02 Jan/18:10] <CJafk> heck yeah
[02 Jan/18:11] <Azmodan> it is not like earlier voodoo's that were seperate 3d only
[02 Jan/18:11] <Boney> but one moniter can only handle 800x600 one the voodoo
[02 Jan/18:11] <CJafk> so?
[02 Jan/18:11] <w98> so is, like, it
[02 Jan/18:11] <Azmodan> your voodoo 3 will handle up to 1280x1024
[02 Jan/18:12] <CJafk> like having two cards is gonna make it better???
[02 Jan/18:12] <Azmodan> but it sounds more like you need a new monitor
[02 Jan/18:12] <Boney> I have a 15" moniter
[02 Jan/18:12] <Elysian> boney: but on the other it does higher?
[02 Jan/18:12] <Elysian> the other card
[02 Jan/18:12] <Azmodan> Boney, you probably only have an 800x600 monitor driver loaded
[02 Jan/18:13] <Elysian> or
[02 Jan/18:13] <CJafk> a 15" should do 1024x768
[02 Jan/18:13] <Elysian> you need to load a monitor driver saying your monitor does 1280x1024... the same exact thing happened to me!
[02 Jan/18:13] <Boney> not on a voodoo
[02 Jan/18:13] <CJafk> SVGA 1024x768
[02 Jan/18:13] <CJafk> yes
[02 Jan/18:13] <CJafk> on a voodoo 3
[02 Jan/18:13] <Azmodan> yes on a voodoo
[02 Jan/18:13] <Elysian> yeah
[02 Jan/18:13] <Azmodan> I'm doing it myself on my own voodoo 3
[02 Jan/18:13] <CJafk> voodoo 2 no...
[02 Jan/18:13] <Elysian> but if you set it to 1024x768 it does the one lower.... 800x600...
[02 Jan/18:13] <CJafk> voodoo 2 was 800x600 i think max
[02 Jan/18:14] <Boney> my moniter can handle 1280x1024
[02 Jan/18:14] <Elysian> boney: but make the v3 think it can
[02 Jan/18:14] <Elysian> then set it to 1024x768 and it should work
[02 Jan/18:14] <Boney> on a voodoo 3 a 15" moniter can handle 800x600
[02 Jan/18:14] <Elysian> boney
[02 Jan/18:14] <Azmodan> Boney, incorrect
[02 Jan/18:14] <Elysian> change the monitor type
[02 Jan/18:14] <Elysian> cause it'll do higher
[02 Jan/18:14] <Elysian> it does 1920x1440 or so i think
[02 Jan/18:15] <Boney> done that
[02 Jan/18:15] <Elysian> boney: changed the monitor type to a higher res monitor?
[02 Jan/18:15] <Boney> done that but can't be changed
[02 Jan/18:16] <Azmodan> Boney of course it can be done
[02 Jan/18:16] <Azmodan> and if you give me a second I'll tell you exactly how
[02 Jan/18:16] <Boney> not on the voodoo
[02 Jan/18:16] <Boney> I'm running on my viper
[02 Jan/18:16] <Azmodan> boney do you want the help
[02 Jan/18:16] <Elysian> boney: you can get it higher trust me!
[02 Jan/18:16] <Boney> yeah

[02 Jan/18:48] <Azmodan> if its on a tcp/ip network just give it a number and ping something

[02 Jan/18:48] <Cat`Woman> well...
[02 Jan/18:48] <Cat`Woman> it is a tcp/ip network, and the cableing is all in place but..

[02 Jan/20:26] <nhobody> im having a big problem
[02 Jan/20:28] ! Kid is known as KidLinux
[02 Jan/20:28] <nhobody> when I run some stuff like aol or netzero to get on the web, it starts connecting, then sometime during the connection my puter completly freezes up, the power off button on the case doesen't even respond so I have to unplug it, anyone know what to tweak so it doesent lock up?

[02 Jan/20:31] <nhobody> up what
[02 Jan/20:31] <nhobody> ?
[02 Jan/20:32] <Deton8R> nada
[02 Jan/20:32] <nhobody> can you help w/my problem?
[02 Jan/20:32] <Deton8R> well, I can try
[02 Jan/20:33] <nhobody> when I run aol or netzero to get on the web, it starts connecting, then sometime during the connection my puter completly freezes up, the power off button on the case doesen't even respond so I have to unplug it,know what to tweak so it doesent lock up?
[02 Jan/20:34] <Deton8R> sounds like either your modem or tcp/ip is hosed
[02 Jan/20:34] <Deton8R> most likely drivers
[02 Jan/20:35] <nhobody> yea, I tried 3 different drivers
[02 Jan/20:35] <Deton8R> alright....have you done anything yet to try to fix it?
[02 Jan/20:35] <Deton8R> k
[02 Jan/20:35] ! `cow is known as ________
[02 Jan/20:36] <nhobody> yea, before my computer would either reboot or lock up (but i could still turn it off) i messed with the i/o and finaly had to reinstall windows, now it works like I just described
[02 Jan/20:36] <Deton8R> so you've tried different drivers for your modem....
[02 Jan/20:36] <nhobody> havent tried anything for the new prob tho
[02 Jan/20:36] <nhobody> yea 3 drivers
[02 Jan/20:36] <Deton8R> alright....and new drivers didn't do anything differently
[02 Jan/20:37] <Deton8R> did you format before you did the reinstall?
[02 Jan/20:37] <Deton8R> or just overinstall
[02 Jan/20:37] <nhobody> the first driver reset my computer, the second two locked it up (before I reinstalled windows)
[02 Jan/20:37] <nhobody> overinstall
[02 Jan/20:38] <Deton8R> considering that you got varied results from different drivers, I really have to ask you if you're 100% certain that those drivers are correct for your modem
[02 Jan/20:38] > w98!azmodan@phi.compinet.com has joined #win98
[02 Jan/20:39] <nhobody> 1 came from the cd packaged w/modem, 1 from the manufactures website and 1 off win98 disk
[02 Jan/20:39] <Deton8R> what modem is this?
[02 Jan/20:39] <Deton8R> pci?
[02 Jan/20:39] <w98> pci is (Peripheral Connect Interface) This interface was designed to supplant the VL-Bus architecture and provide a standard slot with a reduced size for high-speed peripherals. It normally runs at 33 MHz on a PC, but can run faster. PCI slots are 32-bit slots, like EISA or VL-BUS, but in a compact form factor.

[02 Jan/20:40] <nhobody> a pci plug and play 56k modem made by phobes micro
[02 Jan/20:40] <Deton8R> thought so
[02 Jan/20:40] > w98!azmodan@phi.compinet.com has joined #win98
[02 Jan/20:41] <Deton8R> alright...try this
[02 Jan/20:41] <Deton8R> uninstall the modem
[02 Jan/20:41] <Deton8R> turn off the system
[02 Jan/20:42] <Deton8R> physically remove it and restart the system
[02 Jan/20:42] <Deton8R> make SURE all the drivers have been uninstalled
[02 Jan/20:42] <Deton8R> shut down normally
[02 Jan/20:42] <Deton8R> put the modem back in...in A DIFFERENT pci slot
[02 Jan/20:42] <Deton8R> then install the drivers that came with it
[02 Jan/20:43] <nhobody> ok, i moved it before but dident boot up in between
[02 Jan/20:43] <nhobody> ill go try that, be back in a few mins
[02 Jan/20:43] <Deton8R> well, you should make 100% certain that the modem drivers are gone
[02 Jan/20:43] <Deton8R> pci modems use some freaky drivers
[02 Jan/20:44] <nhobody> yea, i should just get an external
[02 Jan/20:45] <Deton8R> they're simpler

[02 Jan/22:16] <pyrokiwi> it may be that when u formatted it wrecked some of the file arcitechure on the disl thus it thinks there is so much space but only some of it is available

[02 Jan/22:25] <Cat`Woman> set it at low
[02 Jan/22:25] <Cat`Woman> then it should come up everytime
[02 Jan/22:25] <pyrokiwi> no i reckon the file architecture was busted
[02 Jan/22:26] <Cat`Woman> well, fdisk and a format would fix it

[03 Jan/07:39] <Marc> I'm all ears
[03 Jan/07:40] <Big`Ed> (start - run - type in (SFC) and click enter)
[03 Jan/07:40] <Big`Ed> scan for altered system files
[03 Jan/07:40] <Marc> I did because I reinstalled WIn again today
[03 Jan/07:40] <Big`Ed> wait
[03 Jan/07:40] <Big`Ed> you just now 'reinstalled windows'
[03 Jan/07:40] <CJ^> wait a min....
[03 Jan/07:40] <Marc> yes this morning in the hope it would work again
[03 Jan/07:40] <Big`Ed> from a 'format' - or by just re-running 'setup'
[03 Jan/07:41] <Marc> rerunning
[03 Jan/07:41] <Big`Ed> k
[03 Jan/07:41] <CJ^> grrrrrrr
[03 Jan/07:41] <Big`Ed> that is not the same as running sfc
[03 Jan/07:41] <Big`Ed> go ahead CJ^
[03 Jan/07:42] <CJ^> he said it happened after a crash
[03 Jan/07:42] <CJ^> AND NOW..
[03 Jan/07:42] <CJ^> he tells us he just reinstalled..
[03 Jan/07:42] <CJ^> an APP caused this...
[03 Jan/07:42] <CJ^> NOW...
[03 Jan/07:42] <Big`Ed> yea - love when EXTRA details comes out
[03 Jan/07:42] <Marc> wait wait
[03 Jan/07:42] <CJ^> all the rerun does it re-screw up the system
[03 Jan/07:42] <Big`Ed> (and that his ISP ran him through all the dun settings)
[03 Jan/07:43] <Marc> untill wednesday everything was working fine,
[03 Jan/07:43] <Big`Ed> (in this case)
[03 Jan/07:43] <Big`Ed> `say
[03 Jan/07:43] <CJ^> ok
[03 Jan/07:43] <CJ^> and what happened wed evening???
[03 Jan/07:43] <CJ^> exactly what happened?
[03 Jan/07:43] <Marc> so it was first on Thursday, but in IE the system freezed up,

[03 Jan/07:44] <Marc> do I list them all again?
[03 Jan/07:44] <CJ^> ok.. but what happened?
[03 Jan/07:44] <Big`Ed> (and netscrape)
[03 Jan/07:44] <CJ^> what crashed?  and what were ya doing at the time?
[03 Jan/07:45] <Marc> Internet explorer crashed, opening a page
[03 Jan/07:45] <CJ^> ok..
[03 Jan/07:45] <CJ^> what page?
[03 Jan/07:45] <CJ^> a heavy Java page???
[03 Jan/07:45] <Marc> sorry can't remeber
[03 Jan/07:45] <Marc> maybe
[03 Jan/07:45] <CJ^> ok..
[03 Jan/07:46] <CJ^> now  Ed took ya through the steps of removing all the DUn, the modem, tcp/ip  basically the network  correct?
[03 Jan/07:46] <Big`Ed> not yet
[03 Jan/07:46] <Big`Ed> thats was step two after a sfc
[03 Jan/07:46] <CJ^> okies

[03 Jan/07:49] <CJ^> ahh ok...
[03 Jan/07:49] <CJ^> dont msg pauly...
[03 Jan/07:49] <CJ^> ask in channel...
[03 Jan/07:49] <Big`Ed> Pauly - win98 questions go ahead
[03 Jan/07:49] <Pauly> sorry
[03 Jan/07:49] <Marc> let me give the Eudora message,
[03 Jan/07:49] <Big`Ed> see topic
[03 Jan/07:49] <Pauly> I have a 16 gig hardrive but it is only reading 2 gigs in win 98
[03 Jan/07:49] <Big`Ed> what is the error from IE or OUTLOOK EXPRESS
[03 Jan/07:50] <CJ^> Pauly.. ok  did you use the win98 boot disk?  and fdisk to partiton the drive?
[03 Jan/07:50] <Big`Ed> ok Pauly - is that the prob?
[03 Jan/07:50] <Pauly> I have
[03 Jan/07:50] <Marc> Error getting network address, cause host not found (error 11001)
[03 Jan/07:50] <CJ^> and does your system supposrt drives larger than 2 gigs?
[03 Jan/07:50] <Pauly> what do u mean the bio
[03 Jan/07:50] <Pauly> bios
[03 Jan/07:50] <CJ^> yes  the bios?
[03 Jan/07:51] <Pauly> I havn
[03 Jan/07:51] <CJ^> does the bios see the full size of the drive?
[03 Jan/07:51] <Pauly> I havn't
[03 Jan/07:51] <Marc> and as last in Netscape it says:
[03 Jan/07:51] <Pauly> no
[03 Jan/07:51] <CJ^> you havent checked???
[03 Jan/07:51] <CJ^> you had to....
[03 Jan/07:51] <Pauly> It is the original bios
[03 Jan/07:51] <Pauly> and it sees 2 gigs
[03 Jan/07:51] <Marc> unable to create a network socket connection.
[03 Jan/07:51] <CJ^> ok.. BUT  when you installed the hard drive.. you had to go in the bios to get it to see that anew drive was attached to the system...
[03 Jan/07:51] <Pauly> yes
[03 Jan/07:51] <CJ^> then your system cannot support drives larger that 2 gigs
[03 Jan/07:52] <Big`Ed> Marc - your total network/dialup is hosed
[03 Jan/07:52] <CJ^> its not a Win98 issue..
[03 Jan/07:52] <Big`Ed> Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet Site <URL>
[03 Jan/07:52] <Big`Ed> A connection with the server could not be established
[03 Jan/07:52] <Big`Ed> 11001 Host not found
[03 Jan/07:52] <Big`Ed> Unable to form connection to the server.
[03 Jan/07:52] <Pauly> is there any way of updating that
[03 Jan/07:52] <CJ^> there may be yes
[03 Jan/07:52] <CJ^> what motherboard do you have?
[03 Jan/07:52] <CJ^> or how old is the system.. what brand?
[03 Jan/07:52] <Pauly> I have a no name mother board
[03 Jan/07:52] <Marc> okay but I removed and reinstalled that
[03 Jan/07:52] <Pauly> Yes it is a pentium non-mmx
[03 Jan/07:52] <CJ^> ok...
[03 Jan/07:52] <CJ^> who made it?
[03 Jan/07:53] <CJ^> the system that is?
[03 Jan/07:53] <Big`Ed> marc - you deleted modem and all networking information completely from PC
[03 Jan/07:53] <Marc> yes
[03 Jan/07:53] <Pauly> Hsin-tech
[03 Jan/07:53] <CJ^> PcChips...
[03 Jan/07:53] <CJ^> ok
[03 Jan/07:53] <Pauly> Yeah 
[03 Jan/07:54] <CJ^> do you know everything that is on the motherboard??
[03 Jan/07:54] <Pauly> like
[03 Jan/07:54] <CJ^> chipset?
[03 Jan/07:54] <CJ^> all that?
[03 Jan/07:54] <Pauly> yeah it is an award
[03 Jan/07:54] <CJ^> do you knwo what they called it
[03 Jan/07:54] <CJ^> no
[03 Jan/07:54] <Big`Ed> Marc - if you have done all these things that you say you have done, your system is beyond a simple over-the-net repair then
[03 Jan/07:54] <Pauly> award bios
[03 Jan/07:54] <Pauly> OPti-viper
[03 Jan/07:54] <CJ^> ick
[03 Jan/07:55] <Marc> that would be bad
[03 Jan/07:55] <Big`Ed> Marc - suggest you take it in for a shop visit - and invest $50 bucks and let them fix it right
[03 Jan/07:55] <Pauly> Opti-viper chip set
[03 Jan/07:55] <CJ^> ok
[03 Jan/07:55] <CJ^> anythign else??
[03 Jan/07:55] <CJ^> sound ?  vidoe on board?? 
[03 Jan/07:55] <Marc> if they know what it is, they always try to sell something completely new
[03 Jan/07:56] <Big`Ed> Marc - that is not required - only other solution would be a 'CLEAN' load of windows
[03 Jan/07:56] <Pauly> no sound
[03 Jan/07:56] <jet350> Marc why dont you format 
[03 Jan/07:56] <Pauly> generic 1 meg video card
[03 Jan/07:56] <CJ^> no
[03 Jan/07:56] <CJ^> thats ok
[03 Jan/07:56] <CJ^> found it
[03 Jan/07:56] <CJ^> well one of 2 boards..
[03 Jan/07:56] <Pauly> ok
[03 Jan/07:56] <CJ^> M519 or m529
[03 Jan/07:56] <Marc> mmm I don't have enough space to save everything first
[03 Jan/07:57] <Big`Ed> Marc - since a trained technicaian can't sit at your PC and look at the problem, a format is in order if you want to do it yourself
[03 Jan/07:57] <CJ^> those boards share the same bios
[03 Jan/07:57] <Pauly> cool
[03 Jan/07:57] <Big`Ed> marc - never heard of backups?
[03 Jan/07:57] <Big`Ed> Marc - what would you do if your system did not turn on at all?
[03 Jan/07:57] <Marc> 4 GB?
[03 Jan/07:58] <Big`Ed> Marc - thats about 7 CD's - or 1 8gb tape - both devices cost under $200
[03 Jan/07:58] <Big`Ed> Marc - or - a second HD can be had for under $100 to store backup data
[03 Jan/07:58] <Marc> here are different prices and I don't have a CD recorder
[03 Jan/07:59] <Big`Ed> Marc - but the issue is - you have a serious problem with your dialup - and a trained technician needs to fix it for you
[03 Jan/07:59] <Big`Ed> Marc - or you can reload win98 clean
[03 Jan/07:59] <CJ^> ok pauly  almost got you a link to a new bios...
[03 Jan/07:59] <Pauly> sweet 
[03 Jan/07:59] <Marc> right I want to use my computer again asap
[03 Jan/08:00] <Pauly> is there a flash utility with the bios
[03 Jan/08:00] <Big`Ed> Marc - you can use your computer now
[03 Jan/08:00] <Big`Ed> Marc - just not for the internet
[03 Jan/08:00] <Marc> yes I meant Internet
[03 Jan/08:00] <Big`Ed> Marc - something happened last week when it frooze

[03 Jan/08:01] <Big`Ed> hi GrungeMan
[03 Jan/08:01] <GrungeMan> i'd like to know if there is a "windows 3.1 advanced" or something like that?
[03 Jan/08:01] <Marc> okay thanks for your time
[03 Jan/08:01] <Big`Ed> Marc - i would have to do it in person - you say you have done everthing
[03 Jan/08:02] <Marc> well as far I know myself
[03 Jan/08:02] <Big`Ed> GrungeMan - there was several versions of windows - 3.0, 3.1, 3.11, wfw3.1, 3.11
[03 Jan/08:02] <GrungeMan> wich is the best? 3.11?
[03 Jan/08:02] <Big`Ed> GrungeMan - win98
[03 Jan/08:03] <Big`Ed> Marc - find a qualified pc technician to look over your pc
[03 Jan/08:03] <Big`Ed> Marc - or perhaps they will do a reload - and save your data
[03 Jan/08:03] <Big`Ed> GrungeMan - what is your win98 question?
[03 Jan/08:03] <GrungeMan> sorry, it's not a win98 question, it's just a "win" question
[03 Jan/08:03] <Marc> no no I will back it up on a old HD and do it self
[03 Jan/08:04] <Big`Ed> oh - sorry
[03 Jan/08:04] <GrungeMan> in the win 3.* series...wich is the besty?
[03 Jan/08:04] <Big`Ed> ok Marc - hopefully a clean install will fix it
[03 Jan/08:04] <Big`Ed> GrungeMan - none - they are no longer supported by Microsoft
[03 Jan/08:04] <GrungeMan> ?
[03 Jan/08:04] <Marc> hope so but I never will know what it was and the same can happen again
[03 Jan/08:05] <GrungeMan> what are the win95 reqs?

[03 Jan/09:14] <Azmodan> does your bios support a drive that large?
[03 Jan/09:14] <FreshBrew> apparently
[03 Jan/09:14] <FreshBrew> it registers as 8.4 in the bios
[03 Jan/09:15] <Azmodan> and did you choose large disk support when you partitioned it?
[03 Jan/09:15] <FreshBrew> its counted as a large disk?
[03 Jan/09:15] <FreshBrew> and would i do that in bios?
[03 Jan/09:16] <Azmodan> no when you run fdisk it asks you a question

[03 Jan/09:46] <SITH> one 98 and other one 95
[03 Jan/09:47] <pyrokiwi> ok but as az said ya need a crossover cable
[03 Jan/09:47] <SITH> what is Crossover Cable
[03 Jan/09:47] <Azmodan> next time before you install something like winroute make sure your network is working
[03 Jan/09:47] <Azmodan> sith, its an ethernet cable that has some pairs crossed
[03 Jan/09:47] <pyrokiwi> best place to get 1 is at a computer wiring supply shop ask 4 one

[03 Jan/10:51] <pyrokiwi> C20H25N3O what with registry editing?
[03 Jan/10:51] <Big`Ed> C20H25N3O - support.microsoft.com
[03 Jan/10:51] <devilDigg> no, no dont you want to get a lan connection? you have a hub right?
[03 Jan/10:51] <devilDigg> and network cards
[03 Jan/10:51] <SITH> and to my brother pc with a ethernet adapter
[03 Jan/10:51] <Big`Ed> Bluecat - what type of pc / system do you have?
[03 Jan/10:51] <devilDigg> ok good
[03 Jan/10:51] <pyrokiwi> nah he has crossover
[03 Jan/10:52] <C20H25N3O> I'm trying to figure out how to ass the password key to the registry for my dial-up networking
[03 Jan/10:52] <Bluecat> ipc
[03 Jan/10:52] <devilDigg> oh you mean you want to connect ethernet with modem?
[03 Jan/10:52] <Big`Ed> no CUSSING
[03 Jan/10:52] <Bluecat> pc
[03 Jan/10:52] <C20H25N3O> sorry
[03 Jan/10:52] <C20H25N3O> add
[03 Jan/10:52] <SITH> yes
[03 Jan/10:52] <Big`Ed> C20H25N3O - what do you mean? - what is prob with password?
[03 Jan/10:52] * devilDigg has never seen one of those connections, so far i've done modem to modem connections with win9x and ethernet to ethenet connection through hub
[03 Jan/10:52] <Big`Ed> Bluecat - what type of system?
[03 Jan/10:52] ! V8LUVAH is known as TORINO
[03 Jan/10:52] <Bluecat> oh ok
[03 Jan/10:53] <C20H25N3O> it's not enabled nor will it save after I enter it, and I don't want to have mircosoft network on my system
[03 Jan/10:53] <SITH> i want to give acces to my brother pc to internet
[03 Jan/10:53] <devilDigg> i've done that
[03 Jan/10:53] <Big`Ed> C20H25N3O - you don't need to edit registry for that
[03 Jan/10:53] <SITH> so..
[03 Jan/10:53] <pyrokiwi> go into network
[03 Jan/10:53] <Big`Ed> C20H25N3O - who told you that?
[03 Jan/10:53] <pyrokiwi> and remove everything
[03 Jan/10:53] <devilDigg> well first: you need to set up a proxy server, and i've used a program for that
[03 Jan/10:53] * Bluecat is looking\
[03 Jan/10:54] <C20H25N3O> Big : I've been playing in the registry for some time now, I put two and two together
[03 Jan/10:54] <SITH> i've used winroute
[03 Jan/10:54] <devilDigg> i cant do it w/out that program , and i think there is no way w/out a progrm for that
[03 Jan/10:54] <SITH> and doesn't work
[03 Jan/10:54] <pyrokiwi> go into your network settings and remove it
[03 Jan/10:54] <Bluecat> i dont know
[03 Jan/10:54] <pyrokiwi> but u need 1 there to connect to net
[03 Jan/10:54] <SITH> winroute?
[03 Jan/10:54] <devilDigg> but then agtain i've only done that through a ethernet to ethernet through hub
[03 Jan/10:54] <Bluecat> ive got lots of info on whats init bt nothing to describe what system
[03 Jan/10:55] <devilDigg> and with nt server as the server..
[03 Jan/10:55] <devilDigg> are you running on nt server?
[03 Jan/10:55] <SITH> no
[03 Jan/10:55] <pyrokiwi> 48speed cdrom for 130$ kiwi
[03 Jan/10:55] <pyrokiwi> hows that
[03 Jan/10:55] <Bluecat> amd k6-2-400mhz
[03 Jan/10:55] <Big`Ed> Bluecat - the reason i ask - is sometimes there is driver problems when you reload, and you need to know what your hardware is up front
[03 Jan/10:56] <devilDigg> then i dont think it cant be done..
[03 Jan/10:56] <devilDigg> or are you running win98?
[03 Jan/10:56] <devilDigg> you are doinga  vpn?
[03 Jan/10:56] <SITH> proxy is better then winroute?
[03 Jan/10:56] <Big`Ed> C20H25N3O - well - you got the wrong answer on your problem to this
[03 Jan/10:57] <SITH> i'm running on 98
[03 Jan/10:57] <Big`Ed> C20H25N3O - microsoft networking is removed from the network properties
[03 Jan/10:57] <SITH> and me brother on 95
[03 Jan/10:57] <C20H25N3O> Big Ed, I don't want the microsoft networking on tho, i jus want the password
[03 Jan/10:57] <devilDigg> i havent seen it
[03 Jan/10:57] <Bluecat> amd k6-2-400mhz <---- is that it ?
[03 Jan/10:57] <Big`Ed> C20H25N3O - passwords not caching - is most common problem because of tweakui, multi-user, or other things that restrict the password from caching
[03 Jan/10:58] <Bluecat> thats the cpu
[03 Jan/10:58] <SITH> what soft do i need to connect them to internet
[03 Jan/10:58] * Bluecat should read more about it
[03 Jan/10:58] <C20H25N3O> Big Ed : I don't use that stuff , not since 95
[03 Jan/10:58] <Big`Ed> Bluecat - that is the cpu - but you need to know your soundcard, video card, other things
[03 Jan/10:58] <devilDigg> but then again im only 14, someone else might know how to do it
[03 Jan/10:58] <Bluecat> i know all that
[03 Jan/10:58] <pyrokiwi> im only 14 to :)
[03 Jan/10:58] <Bluecat> ram, mother board
[03 Jan/10:58] <devilDigg> well the way i've done it is: run nt server..
[03 Jan/10:58] <pyrokiwi> somehow ya managed to get the 2 young ppls
[03 Jan/10:59] ! HigHBabE is known as HigH|AwaY
[03 Jan/10:59] <devilDigg> and have your brother connect through you ethernet: you will need a hub for that
[03 Jan/10:59] <devilDigg> and then get: sql server 
[03 Jan/10:59] <Big`Ed> Bluecat - to do a clean install - there is about 3 steps
[03 Jan/10:59] <pyrokiwi> my friend has it done through a linux 486 server
[03 Jan/10:59] <devilDigg> that program will help you get a proxy server up..
[03 Jan/10:59] <Big`Ed> Bluecat - 1 - make sure you know all your hardware/devices
[03 Jan/10:59] <pyrokiwi> but his bro set it up and his bro prob know more then anyone here
[03 Jan/11:00] <Big`Ed> Bluecat - 2 - boot to dos with win98 boot disk, run FDISK, DELETE PARTITION DATA
[03 Jan/11:00] <SITH> the network betwen the pc is working
[03 Jan/11:00] <devilDigg> oh.. 
[03 Jan/11:00] <Big`Ed> Bluecat - 3 - reboot with disk, reset partition with FDISK, FORMAT C: /S , run setup from CD
[03 Jan/11:00] <devilDigg> then i would suggest you get: sql server
[03 Jan/11:01] <Big`Ed> Bluecat - 4 - (ok i'm off) check all devices - run windowsupdate to update all updates
[03 Jan/11:01] <SITH> what is sql server?
[03 Jan/11:01] <Bluecat> ok thanks

[03 Jan/11:10] <Big`Ed> see TOPIC and ask again
[03 Jan/11:10] <NeoGamlin> It's not a file.
[03 Jan/11:11] <Big`Ed> it is on your win98 cd stored as a file
[03 Jan/11:11] <Big`Ed> and how does one send something that is not a 'file'
[03 Jan/11:11] <NeoGamlin> Easily.
[03 Jan/11:11] <NeoGamlin> I'm sending you stuff right now.
[03 Jan/11:11] <NeoGamlin> Packets.
[03 Jan/11:11] <NeoGamlin> They are headers and information.
[03 Jan/11:11] <NeoGamlin> Not files.
[03 Jan/11:11] <Azmodan> fine NeoGamlin
[03 Jan/11:11] <Big`Ed> ok, you are typing ascii text on your screen
[03 Jan/11:11] <Azmodan> msoe.dll
[03 Jan/11:11] <Azmodan> did you get that packet
[03 Jan/11:11] <Big`Ed> true
[03 Jan/11:11] <Azmodan> go and use it
[03 Jan/11:12] <Big`Ed> and a 'dynamic link libary' is part of a file infrasturcture
[03 Jan/11:12] <NeoGamlin> It's not ascii text, actually.
[03 Jan/11:12] <Azmodan> the packet payload for irc is in ascii text thank you very much
[03 Jan/11:12] <Big`Ed> do you have a problem with using your windows 98 cd for the source of the FILE you are looking for?
[03 Jan/11:12] <Big`Ed> what is a file
[03 Jan/11:13] <Big`Ed> w98 what is a file
[03 Jan/11:13] <NeoGamlin> No.
[03 Jan/11:13] <w98> big`ed: no idea
[03 Jan/11:13] <NeoGamlin> msoe.dll is not on my win98 cd.
[03 Jan/11:13] <NeoGamlin> It doesn't have outlook express 5.
[03 Jan/11:13] <Big`Ed> then you download outlook express again from windowsupdate site
[03 Jan/11:13] <NeoGamlin> I don't want to lose my information.
[03 Jan/11:14] <Azmodan> NeoGamlin, download it again, your on a fast cable modem
[03 Jan/11:14] <Big`Ed> you won't
[03 Jan/11:14] <NeoGamlin> I can't find oe5 on the microsoft site anyways.
[03 Jan/11:14] <NeoGamlin> It's bullshit.
[03 Jan/11:14] <NeoGamlin> It wants to upgrade me.
[03 Jan/11:14] <NeoGamlin> It thinks it's helping..
[03 Jan/11:14] <Azmodan> oi language
[03 Jan/11:14] <NeoGamlin> Sorry.
[03 Jan/11:14] <NeoGamlin> Wasn't aware that everyone here is easily offended.
[03 Jan/11:14] <Azmodan> no offence, its a channel rule
[03 Jan/11:15] <Azmodan> read the rest of the topic
[03 Jan/11:15] <NeoGamlin> Rules have reasons, no?
[03 Jan/11:15] <Big`Ed> if you can't find OE5 on microsoft - you are not looking very hard
[03 Jan/11:15] <Big`Ed> what purpose does your cussing have in helping you?
[03 Jan/11:15] + Azmodan will not have any discussions on the rules
[03 Jan/11:16] <NeoGamlin> Nothing whatsoever.
[03 Jan/11:16] <Big`Ed> it will help you leave the channel faster
[03 Jan/11:16] <NeoGamlin> It was merely an elaboration on my discontent.
[03 Jan/11:16] <NeoGamlin> So far you have been of no aid, no offense intended, so it doesn't bug me that much.
[03 Jan/11:16] <Big`Ed> and this is not the place to express your personal feelings in that manner
[03 Jan/11:16] <devilDigg> hi Azmodan
[03 Jan/11:16] <NeoGamlin> Excuse me.
[03 Jan/11:16] <Azmodan> we adivised you on how to fix your problem. So I guess that is not helpfull
[03 Jan/11:16] <Azmodan> hiya devilDigg 
[03 Jan/11:17] <NeoGamlin> It's fairly easy to say "go download it".
[03 Jan/11:17] <jet350> www.download.com
[03 Jan/11:17] <Big`Ed> well - per the microsoft license, that is the only legal source for a microsoft FILE
[03 Jan/11:17] <Azmodan> its also fairly easy to find it to download.  I'm no ones personal search engine

[03 Jan/11:21] <Trinity^> if I set the matrox primary, they both do what they are supposed
[03 Jan/11:21] <Trinity^> but the matrox sucks, I want my ati rage to be primary

[03 Jan/11:22] <Big`Ed> well - traditionally - if i remember the multimonitor stuff - agp has to be secondary
[03 Jan/11:23] <Big`Ed> unless your motherboard allows you to switch them
[03 Jan/11:23] <Big`Ed> as mine does
[03 Jan/11:23] <Trinity^> mine says init video first
[03 Jan/11:23] <Trinity^> and the options are agp and pci
[03 Jan/11:24] <Trinity^> but if I set agp first, *only* the ati works
[03 Jan/11:24] <Trinity^> no multi monitor
[03 Jan/11:24] <Trinity^> if the pci is set init first
[03 Jan/11:24] <Trinity^> then they both work
[03 Jan/11:24] <Big`Ed> correct - that is the nature of the multi
[03 Jan/11:24] <Trinity^> so the agp can't be the primary?

[03 Jan/11:26] <Big`Ed> it goest o if the motherboard supports it being primary
[03 Jan/11:26] <Trinity^> is that what that "init display first" is for?
[03 Jan/11:27] <Big`Ed> yes - which one init's first
[03 Jan/11:27] <Trinity^> if I set it to AGP
[03 Jan/11:27] <Trinity^> only the rage agp works
[03 Jan/11:27] <Trinity^> if I set it to pci both work

[03 Jan/11:28] <Big`Ed> have you read microsofts stuff on multi?
[03 Jan/11:28] <Big`Ed> agp as primary is NOT norm
[03 Jan/11:28] <Big`Ed> i had to trick mine to do it
[03 Jan/11:28] <Big`Ed> and the doc's say i should not be able to do it
[03 Jan/11:29] <Trinity^> how did you do it?
[03 Jan/11:30] <Big`Ed> in my case, i have a ati as the agp
[03 Jan/11:30] <Big`Ed> and a diamond as pci
[03 Jan/11:31] <Big`Ed> i set the ati as pri on mb

[03 Jan/11:54] <Xanta> Hello ! Anyone familiar with the usage of two screencards in Win98 ?
[03 Jan/11:55] <Big`Ed> sorta
[03 Jan/11:56] <Tara2> i have two drives and want to try win98
[03 Jan/11:56] <Big`Ed> Tara2 - win98 installs easy to the default c: drive
[03 Jan/11:56] <Big`Ed> what OS are you using?
[03 Jan/11:57] <Tara2> there i have win95
[03 Jan/11:57] <Azmodan> w98 no, Azmodan is off eating his lunch
[03 Jan/11:57] <w98> okay, Azmodan.
[03 Jan/11:57] <Xanta> I use CL Geforce256 and Matrox Mystique 4MB. This works fine when the Matrox card is the boot-card, but when I boot with the Geforce card, the system tells me that the driver does not support multiple monitors. (But it works just fine the other way around)
[03 Jan/11:58] <Big`Ed> and you only want to 'try' - expensive purchase for a test
[03 Jan/11:58] <Big`Ed> xanta - that is prob a agp / pci - issue
[03 Jan/11:58] <Big`Ed> Xanta and win98 prefers the Pci card to be primary
[03 Jan/11:59] <GrungeMan> what's the difference if i upgrade my RAM memory and if I upgrade my cpu to a better one...?
[03 Jan/11:59] <Big`Ed> GrungeMan - i answered you 3 times!!!
[03 Jan/11:59] <Xanta> Big`Ed: I can choose this AGP/PCI as boot in the BIOS, but the Matrox does not want to be the "slave" card. I've heard that it'll work fine with an ATI-card.
[03 Jan/12:00] <GrungeMan> arrg, nobody can answer me?
[03 Jan/12:00] <Big`Ed> well - i have a ati card running as primary (agp) and a dimond as secondary
[03 Jan/12:00] <Xanta> GrungeMan: Buy more RAM first.
[03 Jan/12:00] <Big`Ed> and i had to do the bios change
[03 Jan/12:00] <Xanta> OK
[03 Jan/12:01] <Big`Ed> he is lagged out
[03 Jan/12:01] <Xanta> Maybe this is a driver/firmware-problem...
[03 Jan/12:01] <Big`Ed> but to get it to work, you must have only the primary detected/working
[03 Jan/12:01] <Big`Ed> and then add the secondary card to the hardware slot, and let win98 pick it up
[03 Jan/12:01] <Big`Ed> not have both installed
[03 Jan/12:02] <Big`Ed> and switch
[03 Jan/12:02] <Tara2> i shall buy an matrox videocard to my machine and have an hercules card in the machine already

[03 Jan/12:03] <Big`Ed> NeoGamlin
[03 Jan/12:03] <Xanta> Tried that, but 98 won't let the Matrox be the slave card. I have tried to switch hot/cold, and it always works with the Geforce AGP card that was first installed, as slave. Not vice versa.
[03 Jan/12:03] <NeoGamlin> Ok.

[03 Jan/15:47] <CJ^> yes
[03 Jan/15:47] <Trailfaz> it's a 56k flex modem Supervoice and sometimes when I turn on my computer and go to connect to the net, it says it's not there

[03 Jan/15:48] <sk8tr> i tried it and it says the same script error
[03 Jan/15:48] <CJ^> ok..
[03 Jan/15:48] <sk8tr> tried it both ways
[03 Jan/15:48] <CJ^> where are you viewing pics?
[03 Jan/15:48] <Trailfaz> then i go to my resources and for some reason it is always on the irq 03
[03 Jan/15:48] <CJ^> in Explorer?

[03 Jan/15:48] <sk8tr> yes cj
[03 Jan/15:48] <Trailfaz> what makes it keep doing that conflict thing with the modem ?
[03 Jan/15:48] <Trailfaz> anyone know about this ?
[03 Jan/15:49] <CJ^> everything is done in channel..
[03 Jan/15:49] <sk8tr> no...msg me
[03 Jan/15:49] <CJ^> NO
[03 Jan/15:49] <Los`Guy> sk8tr see the topic
[03 Jan/15:49] <sk8tr> YES
[03 Jan/15:49] <sk8tr> ok.....then i will just sit here and cry
[03 Jan/15:49] <jet> sorry CJ
[03 Jan/15:49] <sk8tr> but sriously.......what do i do now CJ?
[03 Jan/15:49] <Trailfaz> everytime i switch it over to another irq  and then next time i turn on my computer again it seems to always go back to that conflict again
[03 Jan/15:49] <Trailfaz> why??????
[03 Jan/15:50] <Trailfaz> it seems to be always conflicting with port com 2 even though when i go to switch it to another irq
[03 Jan/15:50] <CJ^> ok... you may have view as web page set in fodler options as well...
[03 Jan/15:50] <Los`Guy> Trailfaz have you installed YOUR modems drivers (or just win98s)? also you could turn off search for new pnp devices on boot I belive
[03 Jan/15:50] <CJ^> check that in explorer...
[03 Jan/15:50] <sk8tr> ok.........
[03 Jan/15:50] <Big`Ed> Trailfaz - are you installing with your MODEM software?
[03 Jan/15:50] ! HigH_AwaY is known as HigHBabE
[03 Jan/15:51] <sk8tr> ok..it works for now....
[03 Jan/15:51] <sk8tr> but cj.....it never did that before now....
[03 Jan/15:52] <Trailfaz> i don't think i am because when i click on the modem it shows that its there and then when i click on something else , it says MODEM not installed but the modem is setup in my comp.
[03 Jan/15:52] <sk8tr> i could view it as a webpage before and i never had that problem till now
[03 Jan/15:52] <CJ^> sk8tr  run SFC see if any thing pops up
[03 Jan/15:52] <CJ^> might be an IE error..
[03 Jan/15:52] <sk8tr> SFC?
[03 Jan/15:52] <sk8tr> whats that?
[03 Jan/15:52] <CJ^> well  its realted to that
[03 Jan/15:52] <CJ^> Start>run>sfc
[03 Jan/15:52] <CJ^> system file checker
[03 Jan/15:52] <Trailfaz> the modem is setup but prob. windows thinks is not installed 
[03 Jan/15:52] <Big`Ed> Trailfaz - are you installing with your MODEM software?
[03 Jan/15:52] <sk8tr> where is sfc?
[03 Jan/15:52] <Trailfaz> prob. not
[03 Jan/15:53] <Trailfaz> i used the Supervoice CD that i got, is that installing the modem software ?
[03 Jan/15:53] <CJ^> sk8tr   
[03 Jan/15:53] <CJ^> click start
[03 Jan/15:53] <CJ^> then run
[03 Jan/15:53] <CJ^> and they type sfc
[03 Jan/15:53] <Trailfaz> because that's what my modem is a 56K Flex Supervoice for Windows modem
[03 Jan/15:54] <Big`Ed> Trailfaz - you need to fully delete all detected modems, and then go in and install with it's CD
[03 Jan/15:54] <Big`Ed> or check thier web site for newer ones
[03 Jan/15:54] <CJ^> whoo hoo
[03 Jan/15:54] <CJ^> success  
[03 Jan/15:54] <Big`Ed> great
[03 Jan/15:55] <CJ^> CDR succesfully bunred  !!!
[03 Jan/15:55] <CJ^> er burned
[03 Jan/15:55] <Trailfaz> and that will keep it from conflicting and also telling me to install a new modem even though i have one in the comp. setup ?
[03 Jan/15:55] ! __TarZan is known as jaoco
[03 Jan/15:55] <Trailfaz> ok how do i fully delete all detected modems ?
[03 Jan/15:55] <Big`Ed> control panel, modems
[03 Jan/15:55] <Trailfaz> ok
[03 Jan/15:56] <Trailfaz> it shows that my modem is setup for this computer

[03 Jan/16:36] <Danofl> what does that mean vulcan?
[03 Jan/16:36] <devilDigg> heh CJ^
[03 Jan/16:36] <Avi> can you give me some advice on what I can do to see the video on the computer monitor?
[03 Jan/16:36] <Avi> I see the picture on my TV just fine, but not on the PC monitor!
[03 Jan/16:36] <devilDigg> first install the decoder card drivers
[03 Jan/16:36] <Big`Ed> do you have the software installed?
[03 Jan/16:37] <devilDigg> i think he does
[03 Jan/16:37] <Avi> yup...all software is installed
[03 Jan/16:37] <devilDigg> because if he sees it in the tv..
[03 Jan/16:37] <devilDigg> ok.. um
[03 Jan/16:37] <CJ^> disconnect the TV out
[03 Jan/16:37] <devilDigg> what card do you have?
[03 Jan/16:37] <CJ^> shoudl default back to the monitor
[03 Jan/16:37] <devilDigg> what decoder card?
[03 Jan/16:37] <Avi> that's how I am playing the DVD....I move my mouse over the window and look at the TV to see where I am
[03 Jan/16:38] <devilDigg> avi: what decoder card do you have?
[03 Jan/16:38] <devilDigg> a realmagic?
[03 Jan/16:38] <Avi> it's the Creative Labs 6X PC-DVD drive and the DX3 decoder card
[03 Jan/16:38] <devilDigg> oh
[03 Jan/16:39] <Avi> I bought that one because creative labs is a good name, and I'v had nothing but problems!!! heheh
[03 Jan/16:39] <devilDigg> well i woudl recommend you calibrate your monitor
[03 Jan/16:39] <devilDigg> or was it all done?
[03 Jan/16:39] <devilDigg> well its true, but i did it the other way around
[03 Jan/16:40] <Avi> my video card meets the requirements also...it's a Diamond Stealth 3D Pro 2000 with 2Megs of memory
[03 Jan/16:40] <devilDigg> i bought the drive, and i bought a realmagic decoder card
[03 Jan/16:40] <devilDigg> which i like because its never given me errors
[03 Jan/16:40] ! Windies is known as still_ill
[03 Jan/16:41] <Avi> damn... heheh guess I'll be on the phone with creative labs tomm.
[03 Jan/16:41] <devilDigg> email them
[03 Jan/16:41] <devilDigg> tell them what type of monitor you have, what video card, and what computer you have
[03 Jan/16:41] <Avi> if you go into their knowledgebase, it has like 3 questions about what could go wrong, and that's it...
[03 Jan/16:41] <devilDigg> and hope for a reply
[03 Jan/16:41] <Avi> ok, I'll tyr that
[03 Jan/16:41] <Avi> try
[03 Jan/16:41] <Avi> oops
[03 Jan/16:41] <CJ^> i thought the vidceo card had to be DVD capable?
[03 Jan/16:42] <devilDigg> not really
[03 Jan/16:42] <devilDigg> thats why you buy a decoder card
[03 Jan/16:42] <Avi> does your decoder card have a wire that connects to your video card?
[03 Jan/16:42] <devilDigg> oh wait a second
[03 Jan/16:42] <devilDigg> i think i know why
[03 Jan/16:42] <devilDigg> do ou have all the cables
[03 Jan/16:42] <devilDigg> yeah
[03 Jan/16:42] <CJ^> well then the decoder has to be looped back toe the video card
[03 Jan/16:42] <devilDigg> thats what i was about to ask you
[03 Jan/16:42] <devilDigg> it is
[03 Jan/16:42] <devilDigg> it has a loopback cable
[03 Jan/16:42] <Avi> it's like 1/2 the width of an IDE connector
[03 Jan/16:42] <CJ^> right...
[03 Jan/16:42] <devilDigg> you connect the vga cable to the video card
[03 Jan/16:42] <CJ^> there are two types
[03 Jan/16:43] <CJ^> internal and external loop backs..
[03 Jan/16:43] <devilDigg> and the side that goes to the decoder card is like a ps/2 port
[03 Jan/16:43] <Avi> and I made sure I had the red line on pin 1....so I don't know what it could be
[03 Jan/16:43] <CJ^> the first your talking about is internal
[03 Jan/16:43] <devilDigg> and you connect your monitor to the decoder card
[03 Jan/16:43] <devilDigg> yeah
[03 Jan/16:43] <CJ^> and can only be used with DVD capable video cards...
[03 Jan/16:43] <devilDigg> i have the external one
[03 Jan/16:43] <Avi> yea, mine is all internal....
[03 Jan/16:43] <devilDigg> i would recommend the external one
[03 Jan/16:43] <CJ^> thats why
[03 Jan/16:44] <CJ^> the kit is suppoed to come with BOTH
[03 Jan/16:44] <Avi> so I need to get a new video card?
[03 Jan/16:44] <devilDigg> go to the dr3 or whatever u call it
[03 Jan/16:44] <CJ^> no..
[03 Jan/16:44] <devilDigg> website
[03 Jan/16:44] <devilDigg> and ask them for a external loopback cable
[03 Jan/16:44] <Avi> external as in a 15 pin vga connector?
[03 Jan/16:44] <devilDigg> yea
[03 Jan/16:44] <devilDigg> and the other side is like a ps/2 port
[03 Jan/16:45] <Avi> actually let me look at it a sec
[03 Jan/16:45] <devilDigg> that you connect to the decoder card, and you connect your monitor to the decoder card
[03 Jan/16:46] <CJ^> the kit does come with both
[03 Jan/16:46] <CJ^> just looked it up
[03 Jan/16:46] <CJ^> also comes with an instruction book...heh
[03 Jan/16:46] <Avi> well....this decoder card doesn't have that external 15 pin VGA connector on it
[03 Jan/16:47] <Avi> instruction book sucks...as most of them do!!! heheheh
[03 Jan/16:47] <Avi> so, should I just try a new video card, and the internal connection....I mean I only have a 2 meg video card
[03 Jan/16:48] <CJ^> go for it...
[03 Jan/16:48] <CJ^> TNT, ATI
[03 Jan/16:48] <devilDigg> well
[03 Jan/16:48] <Avi> cool...thanks

[03 Jan/17:16] <LosGuy> with what nice-18?
[03 Jan/17:17] <LosGuy> we wont know till we hear the problem
[03 Jan/17:18] <nice-18> i'm on my shitty comptuer rightnow...but my good computer..after i started it after y2k..it hangs right before windows startups..i'm pretty sure its a driver problem or something like that...i know its not y2k related..but so do you htink re-installing win98 would help me?
[03 Jan/17:18] <LosGuy> no cussing
[03 Jan/17:18] <nice-18> oh i'm sorry
[03 Jan/17:18] <LosGuy> depends on what is causing it
[03 Jan/17:18] <Wolf^^> I hate to ask this because I'm sure yall know yalls stuff...but you're sure it's a part of the cdrom driver crap??
[03 Jan/17:18] <LosGuy> try a logged boot
[03 Jan/17:19] <LosGuy> then boot to safe mode and fix it
[03 Jan/17:19] <LosGuy> the logged boot will tell you where it failed
[03 Jan/17:19] <nice-18> safe mode works....thats why i'm pretty sure its a driver problem
[03 Jan/17:19] <nice-18> what does a logged boot do?
[03 Jan/17:19] <LosGuy> [20:20] <LosGuy> the logged boot will tell you where it failed

[03 Jan/17:52] <CJ^> no

[03 Jan/18:04] <pyrokiwi> i used an OLD mac laptop
[03 Jan/18:04] * LosGuy has no desire to use a mac either
[03 Jan/18:04] <Wolf^^> Now could it be that explorer is the bad guy and nit the dll?
[03 Jan/18:05] <pyrokiwi> probably
[03 Jan/18:05] <CJ^> explorer is run by dll and other files...
[03 Jan/18:05] <CJ^> hence if a file is bad...
[03 Jan/18:05] <CJ^> explore may nto work correctly...
[03 Jan/18:05] * pyrokiwi wonders if imacs really taste like grapes
[03 Jan/18:05] <Wolf^^> though if that were the case, then I wouldn't be able to do anything...or so I think
[03 Jan/18:05] <CJ^> no
[03 Jan/18:05] <CJ^> not actually..
[03 Jan/18:05] <CJ^> a part of the OS can go down.. or nto be usable...
[03 Jan/18:06] <CJ^> but  doenst mean the whole thign woudl go down...
[03 Jan/18:06] <CJ^> like if a sparkplug goes bad in a car... doesnt mean teh car is undrivable..
[03 Jan/18:06] <Wolf^^> Ok..so just try doing this thing with the dll in dos and see if that works
[03 Jan/18:06] <CJ^> just means the plug needs replacing..

[03 Jan/18:24] <Wolf^^> When I did that, it asked me to replace the current for the copy and I said yes
[03 Jan/18:24] <LosGuy> ok
[03 Jan/18:25] <Wolf^^> so couldn't I just restart in DOS, rename the old, but instead of hitting the CD for the new, copy again from the temp dir?

[03 Jan/18:26] <LosGuy> yes

[03 Jan/22:14] <Pauly> quick question I have an old mother-board with a P-120 and want to put a 16 gig hardrive on it.  I Fdisked the drive and it only reads 2 gigs and says the h-drive is full.  I updated my bios and now I only have 1 gig!!!!!!!!
[03 Jan/22:14] <LosQ3> soh
[03 Jan/22:14] <LosQ3> doh even
[03 Jan/22:15] <LosQ3> you might try a drive overlay (but they blow imho)
[03 Jan/22:16] <Pauly> I know my mother-board sucks but I am just trying to get it working!
[03 Jan/22:16] <LosQ3> uh interesting that it is 2gb wich was the dos fat32 limit
[03 Jan/22:16] <LosQ3> your choosing large hd support and using fat32 right?
[03 Jan/22:17] ! ReMaX is known as ReMaXaway
[03 Jan/22:17] <Pauly> I am using fat32 
[03 Jan/22:17] <Pauly> I didn't see large hd support anywhere
[03 Jan/22:18] <LosQ3> fdisk will ask when you first start it
[03 Jan/22:18] <LosQ3> only thing that I can think of is try a drive overlay
[03 Jan/22:19] <LosQ3> most HD manufacturers make them available
[03 Jan/22:19] <LosQ3> ie Ontrack or maxtors ezdrive etc

[03 Jan/22:20] <Pauly> do u think I could be missing a setting in the bios somewhere to enable large disk support

[03 Jan/22:20] <LosQ3> is it seen as LBA ?
[03 Jan/22:20] <LosQ3> or do you even have the option?
[03 Jan/22:21] <LosQ3> did your bios up grade allow for large hard drives?
[03 Jan/22:21] <Pauly> Yes it is seen as an LBA
[03 Jan/22:21] <Pauly> I wasn't to sure! somebody in this channel gave it to me :)
[03 Jan/22:21] <LosQ3> gave you a link to it you mean?
[03 Jan/22:22] <LosQ3> or the actual files?
[03 Jan/22:22] <Pauly> the actual files
[03 Jan/22:23] <LosQ3> hmmm
[03 Jan/22:23] <LosQ3> very odd since we do not do files here of any sort

[03 Jan/22:23] <LosQ3> and I am shocked that you actually ran them
[03 Jan/22:24] <Knocks> is there a command to look up another irc user's workgroup name in win98
[03 Jan/22:24] @ mode #win98 [+v Knocks] by Zeus!pegasys@tigerrose.grateful.org
[03 Jan/22:24] <LosQ3> it depends ... and in win98 no
[03 Jan/22:25] <LosQ3> there are third party apps that will get all available info from an IP 
[03 Jan/22:25] <LosQ3> ie finger etc
[03 Jan/22:25] <Knocks> i c
[03 Jan/22:25] <LosQ3> free third party apps too
[03 Jan/22:25] <LosQ3> and some firewalls are very good at picking that info up
[03 Jan/22:26] <LosQ3> ie blackice defender
[03 Jan/22:26] <Knocks> but it's not really a concern if somebody finds out your group name is it
[03 Jan/22:26] <LosQ3> well
[03 Jan/22:26] ! drag0n` is known as el`b|indo
[03 Jan/22:26] <LosQ3> that in itself is only of limited use
[03 Jan/22:26] <LosQ3> but if you have shares enabled and not at least password protected
[03 Jan/22:26] <LosQ3> you are sharing with the world
[03 Jan/22:27] <Knocks> you mean if i have particular folders shared?
[03 Jan/22:27] <LosQ3> yes ...even your printert
[03 Jan/22:27] <LosQ3> printer
[03 Jan/22:27] <Knocks> i don't
[03 Jan/22:28] <LosQ3> then you have little to worry about unless your running a server
[03 Jan/22:28] <Knocks> some a$$hole was trying to tease me cuz he found out the name of my workgroup and i was concerned first
[03 Jan/22:28] <LosQ3> hmm just a sec
[03 Jan/22:28] <Knocks> because the name of my group matches the name of one of the files on my desktop
[03 Jan/22:28] <Knocks> so i thought he was able to browse my desktop and stuff
[03 Jan/22:29] ! DarK^LuVr is known as DarKAFK
[03 Jan/22:29] <LosQ3> nah
[03 Jan/22:30] <Knocks> :)
[03 Jan/22:30] <LosQ3> unlikely unless your infected with a trojan or have an unsecure setup 
[03 Jan/22:30] <LosQ3> with file and printer sharing
[03 Jan/22:30] <Knocks> well that's what i thought had happened
[03 Jan/22:30] <Knocks> especially with all the rumors about the new trojans and stuff
[03 Jan/22:30] <LosQ3> w98 where is conseal
[03 Jan/22:30] <w98> i haven't a clue, losq3
[03 Jan/22:31] <LosQ3> sheez
[03 Jan/22:31] <Knocks> and then i got the blue screen
[03 Jan/22:31] <LosQ3> go to signal9.com and get a firewall if your concerned
[03 Jan/22:31] <Knocks> so i thought he had planted a trojan on my system and was accessing my hard drive

[04 Jan/09:31] <CJ^> you may also have to check the bios for the PM settings
[04 Jan/09:31] <MajicEyes> ok I will go look at the BIOS settings
[04 Jan/09:32] <MajicEyes> I don't think they are on in there either tho
[04 Jan/09:32] <MajicEyes> BTW i'm talkin afterr like 5 min not an hr or nothing
[04 Jan/09:33] <CJ^> Majic  thats PM settings
[04 Jan/09:33] <CJ^> i have mine set to turn off after an hour
[04 Jan/09:33] <MajicEyes> OK i will log off & reboot & check them but I think it should be ok
[04 Jan/09:34] <MajicEyes> if it matters I have 3 HD's & it seems like it takes 4 ever to get things rollin
[04 Jan/09:34] <CJ^> well the OS takes the PM calls from the BIOS

[04 Jan/09:50] <Azmodan> hey ozzy
[04 Jan/09:50] <CJ^> also  win98SE has a good help file on ICS...
[04 Jan/09:51] <oracle^> Not in the german version I guess.
[04 Jan/09:51] <oracle^> The help file just explains the work principle. But there is nothing about security and privacy.
[04 Jan/09:52] <CJ^> hmm  true...
[04 Jan/09:52] ! frys--- is known as pau1
[04 Jan/09:52] <Azmodan> oracle, it is no more or less secure than just one pc useing the net
[04 Jan/09:52] <CJ^> i dont think MS had security in mind when they made ICS..
[04 Jan/09:52] <CJ^> think it more of just letting ppl share the Inet connection...
[04 Jan/09:53] <CJ^> more robust apps are needed for security
[04 Jan/09:53] <oracle^> Youre right about this.
[04 Jan/09:54] <oracle^> But before I use it, I would like to knwo if on the gateway computer the client session can be monitored easily
[04 Jan/09:54] <CJ^> funny thing is..  i dont feel MS thinks ppl that use win9x are concerned about security....
[04 Jan/09:54] <Azmodan> oracle, define monitored
[04 Jan/09:54] <oracle^> I know wingate, and this has the posibility to save all the URLS in a cache directory. It shows the URL´s  on the gateway computer

[04 Jan/09:56] [oracle^> Azmodan:
[04 Jan/09:57] [oracle^> Azmodan: Monitoring means for me: That the URLS, e.g. Chat conversation is saved in a readable form on the gateway computer.

[04 Jan/09:59] <CJ^> oracle.. 
[04 Jan/09:59] <CJ^> the MS DB does nto show anytign about security issues with ICS..
[04 Jan/10:00] <CJ^> it doesnt explain these things cause i agree aith Az...  its not there..
[04 Jan/10:00] <CJ^> ICS wasnt meant to be secure...  just to share the connection  and thats all...
[04 Jan/10:00] <Azmodan> oracle, you WILL need a sniffer to watch client/server communication
[04 Jan/10:03] <oracle^> Àzmodan: I know Win98 isnt a secure system, but Its important to know how insecure it is if you use it.
[04 Jan/10:04] <oracle^> And to use a packet sniffer is a thing thats a little bit complicatet to normal users without to much experience i guess
[04 Jan/10:04] <CJ^> oracle.. again  MS wasnt concerned with security to that level with a consumer OS...

[04 Jan/10:07] <CJ^> right...

[04 Jan/12:49] <CJ^> min reeq for the OS doesnt mean the system will run as fast as it can...
[04 Jan/12:49] <AnyOne> so what component of the ie 5 suite would cause the problem?
[04 Jan/12:49] <CJ^> the faster the system.. the better off you are in reality

[04 Jan/12:51] <CJ^> shut down anything runing in the backgroud as well..
[04 Jan/12:51] <AnyOne> in the near future I hope to upgrade to a Pentium, but in the meantime would I be better off to dump win 98 and go back to win95 or dump ie 5?

[04 Jan/12:52] <CJ^> thats up to you really..

[04 Jan/13:34] <Azmodan> could be anything
[04 Jan/13:34] <Big`Ed> if your running to many protocols, you can loose extra too
[04 Jan/13:35] <Deth|afk> I'm running IPX/SPX, NetBEUI, NETBIOS and TCP/IP
[04 Jan/13:36] <Deth|afk> Does running inet sharing over the network slow it down?
[04 Jan/13:36] <Big`Ed> why are you running 4 protocols?
[04 Jan/13:36] <Deth|afk> Like trying to share inet and transfer files over lan at the same time
[04 Jan/13:36] <Azmodan> deth, are you connecting to novell networks>
[04 Jan/13:36] <Deth|afk> well
[04 Jan/13:36] <Big`Ed> if your network's primary function is internet, just use TCP/IP
[04 Jan/13:36] <Deth|afk> no?
[04 Jan/13:36] <Big`Ed> you can loose all the others then
[04 Jan/13:36] <Deth|afk> all of them?
[04 Jan/13:37] <Big`Ed> except tcp/ip
[04 Jan/13:37] ! ^col is known as ColSander
[04 Jan/13:37] <Big`Ed> provided you have that protocol configured
[04 Jan/13:37] <Deth|afk> weird thing is, it was fine untill i tried it with a new machine, 2 others of mine are fine, but the 3rd one is the machine its very slow with
[04 Jan/13:37] <Azmodan> but note if you only have tcp/ip then you'll need to find some way to transfer data between pc's
[04 Jan/13:37] <Big`Ed> is the third one last on the chain?
[04 Jan/13:37] <Azmodan> e.g. mp3's
[04 Jan/13:38] <Deth|afk> Big`Ed: yeah, its last
[04 Jan/13:38] * Big`Ed uses tcp/ip only - and works fine for intramachine
[04 Jan/13:38] <Big`Ed> Deth|afk - sounds like your last link went bad
[04 Jan/13:38] <Deth|afk> ?
[04 Jan/13:38] <Big`Ed> you can troublshoot by moving the PC to postion 2 and seeing if it gets faster
[04 Jan/13:39] <Big`Ed> Deth|afk - if this problem JUST started
[04 Jan/13:40] <Big`Ed> and is on the last leg
[04 Jan/13:40] <Big`Ed> i suspect a connection, or a termination went bad on the last run

[04 Jan/13:41] <Deth|afk> Big`Ed: yep
[04 Jan/13:41] <Big`Ed> a connects to b - b connects to c
[04 Jan/13:41] <Big`Ed> and c has the terminator
[04 Jan/13:41] <Deth|afk> yes

[04 Jan/13:42] <Lawson> Big 'Ed: It has to do with protecting ones self against viruses that utilize scripting. I think it is Visual Basic Scripting.
[04 Jan/13:42] <j3ss1> hi
[04 Jan/13:42] <Deth|afk> my machine in position c was replaced by my friends
[04 Jan/13:43] <Deth|afk> MY computer normally in pos. c is fine.
[04 Jan/13:43] <Big`Ed> and it is ONLY that pc that has never been fast?
[04 Jan/13:43] <Deth|afk> but my friends machine in pos. c is hell slow.
[04 Jan/13:43] <Deth|afk> its only just been introduced
[04 Jan/13:43] <Deth|afk> first time
[04 Jan/13:43] <NsAnEoNe> Yo Big Ed.....Got the computer working great now...and now remember why I used to like gaming so much
[04 Jan/13:43] <Big`Ed> does C work fast in B pos?
[04 Jan/13:43] <Big`Ed> great NsAnEoNe
[04 Jan/13:43] <Deth|afk> havet tried
[04 Jan/13:43] <Deth|afk> but
[04 Jan/13:43] <Deth|afk> i'm thinking
[04 Jan/13:43] <Deth|afk> its maybe NIC or computer prob?
[04 Jan/13:44] <Deth|afk> seeing my machine which is usually in pos c is fine
[04 Jan/13:44] <NsAnEoNe> I think IM going to end up being a Quake 3 junkie
[04 Jan/13:44] <Deth|afk> and its the new machine in pos c thats slow
[04 Jan/13:44] <Big`Ed> hehe - once hooked, your there
[04 Jan/13:44] <NsAnEoNe> yeah...no doubt...I dont think I will ever be able to go back to work
[04 Jan/13:44] <NsAnEoNe> eheh
[04 Jan/13:45] <Big`Ed> Deth|afk - prob could have occured on the swap - you need to troubleshoot - by switching back, and checking all the connections
[04 Jan/13:45] <Big`Ed> haha
[04 Jan/13:45] <Deth|afk> hmm
[04 Jan/13:45] <Deth|afk> well
[04 Jan/13:45] <Deth|afk> not worth it
[04 Jan/13:45] <Big`Ed> NOT?
[04 Jan/13:45] <Deth|afk> seeing the machine will be gone soon anyway
[04 Jan/13:45] <Big`Ed> ok
[04 Jan/13:45] <Deth|afk> just frustrating at the moment
[04 Jan/13:46] <Big`Ed> it could be as simple as re-twisting the connection on one coax
[04 Jan/13:46] <Deth|afk> did that

[04 Jan/16:06] <BoxerJoe> patition 1 is PRI DOS  C:\  2047 mhb   and 2  doesnt have a drive letter and it says 6009 mb
[04 Jan/16:06] <BoxerJoe> how can I use the 6009 mb
[04 Jan/16:06] <BigEd> BoxerJoe - i suggest starting again
[04 Jan/16:06] <BigEd> BoxerJoe - from win98 boot disk
[04 Jan/16:06] <Azmodan> boxerJoe, create logical partitions inside it
[04 Jan/16:06] <BigEd> BoxerJoe - run FDISK
[04 Jan/16:06] <BoxerJoe> how do I do that?
[04 Jan/16:06] <BigEd> BoxerJoe - delete what you have
[04 Jan/16:06] <BoxerJoe> I have fdisk up
[04 Jan/16:06] <BoxerJoe> I am not reformatting again today
[04 Jan/16:06] <BigEd> BoxerJoe - then reboot
[04 Jan/16:06] <BoxerJoe> have done it 5 times
[04 Jan/16:07] <BigEd> BoxerJoe - best time to do it - make 1 big drive
[04 Jan/16:07] <BoxerJoe> Whats the difference? 
[04 Jan/16:07] <BoxerJoe> will it slow things down?
[04 Jan/16:07] <BigEd> you will need to change from c: to D: for data/storage
[04 Jan/16:07] <BigEd> instead of all on c:
[04 Jan/16:08] <BigEd> (don't know why you did it 5 times - when 1 is all that is needed after a FDISK)
[04 Jan/16:08] <BigEd> but if you want, you can boot to dos, use fdisk, and setup the exter 4gb
[04 Jan/16:08] <BigEd> and then format them
[04 Jan/16:08] <BoxerJoe> I tried lnux earlier too
[04 Jan/16:08] <BigEd> then win98 will see them
[04 Jan/16:09] <BigEd> thats why your other space is gone then
[04 Jan/16:09] <BigEd> it took it
[04 Jan/16:10] <BoxerJoe> how do I get it back from the hog?
[04 Jan/16:10] <BoxerJoe> lol
[04 Jan/16:10] <BoxerJoe> I formatted since I installed it
[04 Jan/16:10] <BigEd> format only works with drive space windows sees
[04 Jan/16:10] <BigEd> windows don't see other OS's partitons
[04 Jan/16:10] <BigEd> so thats why you needed to FDISK all along
[04 Jan/16:10] <BoxerJoe> ok how do I make windows see that then?
[04 Jan/16:10] <BigEd> to re-partion it back to win98
[04 Jan/16:11] <BoxerJoe> so I reboot and?
[04 Jan/16:12] <BoxerJoe> goto dos prompt
[04 Jan/16:12] <BigEd> boot to win98 boot disk
[04 Jan/16:12] <BigEd> run fdisk
[04 Jan/16:12] <BigEd> delete all partition data
[04 Jan/16:12] <BoxerJoe> then FDISK
[04 Jan/16:12] <BigEd> reboot with disk
[04 Jan/16:12] <BigEd> then FDISK again
[04 Jan/16:12] <BigEd> create 1 - single - large partition
[04 Jan/16:12] <BigEd> reboot again with disk

[04 Jan/16:44] <Los`Guy> BoxerJoe did you make these partitions with linux?
[04 Jan/16:44] <Big`Ed> BoxerJoe - how to use your 8.4 - you should have NEVER messed with that other OS
[04 Jan/16:44] <BoxerJoe> one was with  
[04 Jan/16:44] <BoxerJoe> but I formatted everything earlier
[04 Jan/16:44] <Los`Guy> use linux to remove it then
[04 Jan/16:44] <BoxerJoe> i installed linux earlier
[04 Jan/16:44] <Los`Guy> linux fdisk
[04 Jan/16:44] <Big`Ed> but you did NOT change partition info
[04 Jan/16:44] <BoxerJoe> and formatted everything to go  back to windows
[04 Jan/16:45] <Los`Guy> or partition magic
[04 Jan/16:45] <Big`Ed> that UNIX changed on you
[04 Jan/16:45] <Los`Guy> it works 
[04 Jan/16:45] <BoxerJoe> I dont have linux anymore

[04 Jan/17:36] <NeoGamlin> All the icons on my system tray are one notch below the clock
[04 Jan/17:36] <NeoGamlin> They aren't beside the clock, they are below it.
[04 Jan/17:36] <NeoGamlin> How can I make it back to normal?
[04 Jan/17:37] <CJbat> the task bar is larger...

[04 Jan/17:37] <NeoGamlin> 1
[04 Jan/17:37] <NeoGamlin> 1 notch
[04 Jan/17:37] <NeoGamlin> thats the thing
[04 Jan/17:37] <CJbat> just put the mouse over the taskbar till the pointer splits.. and drag it lower..
[04 Jan/17:37] <NeoGamlin> Nope
[04 Jan/17:37] <NeoGamlin> That doesn't work

[04 Jan/17:40] <devilDigg> like i and cj said
[04 Jan/17:40] <devilDigg> drag the taskbar down
[04 Jan/17:40] <CJbat> among other things yes
[04 Jan/17:41] <NeoGamlin> Trust me.
[04 Jan/17:41] <NeoGamlin> I've been using windows for 7 years.
[04 Jan/17:41] <NeoGamlin> I know to drag it down.
[04 Jan/17:41] <NeoGamlin> It doesn't work.
[04 Jan/17:41] <devilDigg> well trust me
[04 Jan/17:41] <NeoGamlin> I need to get rid of those |  lines
[04 Jan/17:41] <NeoGamlin> Is there a way I can do it?
[04 Jan/17:42] <devilDigg> hold down shift and drag down
[04 Jan/17:42] <NeoGamlin> No deal.
[04 Jan/17:42] <NeoGamlin> The icon is still one below the clock.
[04 Jan/17:42] <NeoGamlin> Even after removing the clock and putting it back on..
[04 Jan/17:43] <NeoGamlin> It's because there is an extra "|" thing .. is my guess.
[04 Jan/17:44] <devilDigg> then refresh windows
[04 Jan/17:44] <NeoGamlin> How would I do that?
[04 Jan/17:44] <CJbat> F5
[04 Jan/17:45] <CJbat> or
[04 Jan/17:45] <CJbat> right click on the desktop and click refresh
[04 Jan/17:45] <CJbat> 7 years huh?
[04 Jan/17:45] <NeoGamlin> Yes.
[04 Jan/17:45] <NeoGamlin> I'm familiar with f5.
[04 Jan/17:45] <NeoGamlin> Yet that didn't seem to do anything.
[04 Jan/17:46] <NeoGamlin> There is still the stupid divider.
[04 Jan/17:47] <NeoGamlin> Any other ideas?
[04 Jan/17:47] <CJbat> well.. what started this?

[04 Jan/18:18] <LosQ3> probably
[04 Jan/18:18] <Biggs> i tried
[04 Jan/18:18] <Biggs> but for somereason the NT drivers aren't working
[04 Jan/18:19] <Biggs> i hate microsoft ;p
[04 Jan/18:21] <CJafk> oh  yeah  its MS fault
[04 Jan/18:21] <CJafk> MS doesnt even make the drivers.. and its theri fault..
[04 Jan/18:21] <CJafk> good call...
[04 Jan/18:22] <Biggs> they need to get the manufactures copies to make the drivers for their products
[04 Jan/18:22] <LosQ3> people are just spoiled by windows
[04 Jan/18:22] <CJafk> Biggs they do...
[04 Jan/18:22] <Biggs> ok dude whatever

[04 Jan/18:23] <Biggs> that will take along time
[04 Jan/18:23] <CJafk> no..
[04 Jan/18:24] <LosQ3> gee that must be why betas get CDs
[04 Jan/18:24] <CJafk> but a lot of ppl "test" it from a copy they got at work.. or from a friend...
[04 Jan/18:24] <Biggs> and that's why i have it
[04 Jan/18:24] <LosQ3> no
[04 Jan/18:24] <Biggs> i got server and pro
[04 Jan/18:24] <CJafk> then why are ya testing it in Windows sucks??
[04 Jan/18:24] <LosQ3> I know many people that have it with 56K ... but they are doing warez
[04 Jan/18:24] <CJafk> windows isnt the issue..
[04 Jan/18:24] <CJafk> the maker of the card is...
[04 Jan/18:25] <CJafk> 3dfx IS workign with MS..
[04 Jan/18:25] <Biggs> well i wouldn't even know were to look
[04 Jan/18:25] <CJafk> always has
[04 Jan/18:25] <CJafk> WHQL...
[04 Jan/18:25] <Biggs> im a linux users but i put a app in to test win2k and i got chosen
[04 Jan/18:25] <Biggs> all i asked if u knew were to find drivers

[04 Jan/18:25] <Biggs> i have 3dfx drivers, usb, video, sound
[04 Jan/18:26] <CJafk> and there is a difference between linux and windows...
[04 Jan/18:26] <Biggs> it's not that great with drivers but i still have everything i need
[04 Jan/18:26] <CJafk> then again..
[04 Jan/18:26] <CJafk> if windows sucks  why are you testing it??
[04 Jan/18:26] <Biggs> im just saying the beta testers need to have the drivers they need so they can test things
[04 Jan/18:26] <Biggs> for the hell of it and for a free copy
[04 Jan/18:26] <CJafk> no...
[04 Jan/18:26] <Biggs> so i don't have to pay 170 bucks

[04 Jan/21:44] <pyrokiwi> oh i see i though he was talking bout virus wasnt watching anything else

[04 Jan/21:44] <pyrokiwi> yeh i saw
[04 Jan/21:44] <pyrokiwi> sorta
[04 Jan/21:44] <Gdubya> I'd like the 2nd ed., but can I load it cold?
[04 Jan/21:44] <pyrokiwi> but didnt click was thinking
[04 Jan/21:45] <LosQ3> Gdubya you can if you have win95 and buy the upgrade
[04 Jan/21:45] <CJ^> yes Gdubya...
[04 Jan/21:45] <CJ^> you can install it clean...
[04 Jan/21:45] <Gdubya> I have heard bad things about the upgrade and my win95 is oem
[04 Jan/21:45] <LosQ3> it will ask for proof that you qualify (your win95 cd... 3.1 disks etc)
[04 Jan/21:45] <Gdubya> I want to get away from the oem, pain in the butt
[04 Jan/21:45] <pyrokiwi> he was offering me the virus 4 free not win98
[04 Jan/21:46] <LosQ3> either way not someone we want here pyro
[04 Jan/21:46] <pyrokiwi> lol he didnt mean it that way but nevermind
[04 Jan/21:46] <Gdubya> I want to wipe out win95 once and for all and install win98, get rid of all this crap on the oem
[04 Jan/21:47] <CJ^> you can
[04 Jan/21:47] <CJ^> even with teh upgrade...
[04 Jan/21:47] <CJ^> you dont need to have win95 installed to use the upgrade...
[04 Jan/21:47] <Gdubya> so getting win98 second ed.. will I need my win95 disc?
[04 Jan/21:47] <LosQ3> but is OEM qualifying
[04 Jan/21:47] <CJ^> yes  you will need it
[04 Jan/21:47] <CJ^> OEM shoud be...
[04 Jan/21:47] <Gdubya> good.. so I can f disk in dos and then load win 98?
[04 Jan/21:48] <CJ^> any OEM.. compaq, hp and all has to qualify....
[04 Jan/21:48] <LosQ3> use the fdisk that will come with win98
[04 Jan/21:48] <CJ^> otherwise..  think we would have a big uproar...
[04 Jan/21:48] <LosQ3> or make one from the disk before wiping your system
[04 Jan/21:48] <Gdubya> ahh I see
[04 Jan/21:48] <LosQ3> win98 boot disk has cdrom support...make sure it works for you
[04 Jan/21:48] <LosQ3> then just wipe the disk and install it
[04 Jan/21:49] <Gdubya> I have an hp 166 and everytime a file is corrupted I have to use the Edisk and it loads all that crap on my puter
[04 Jan/21:49] <Gdubya> then I have to clean it all out.. enough is enough
[04 Jan/21:50] <Gdubya> ok now all I have to do is find a good price

[04 Jan/22:13] <CJ^> see  win98 checks first....
[04 Jan/22:13] <CJ^> then you can have it search for hardwre  or  not search and add your onw..

[04 Jan/22:22] <CJ^> it is..
[04 Jan/22:22] <ryanste^n> I reinstalled win09 over an old breaking ver of win98 and everything was detected except that.
[04 Jan/22:22] <CJ^> its a cmoon card with cd-r and scanners..

[04 Jan/22:22] <CJ^> ok...
[04 Jan/22:23] <CJ^> http://www.smartandfriendly.com/tech/safsupport/installation/scsi2install.htm   <<< did you follow these instructions?
[04 Jan/22:23] <CJ^> you have conflict..
[04 Jan/22:24] <CJ^> and ya need to change the jumpers on the card...
[04 Jan/22:26] <ryanste^n> no conflict
[04 Jan/22:28] <CJ^> how do ya know?
[04 Jan/22:28] <CJ^> S&F's site does show that thats a possibllity
[04 Jan/22:28] <ryanste^n> cos I checked the resources.
[04 Jan/22:29] <CJ^> and a crash during detection indicates that as well...
[04 Jan/22:29] <ryanste^n> it's been installed heaps of times, but I've never had the problem where windows doesn't see it at all.

[05 Jan/08:36] <jeper> does ne of you know if it is possible to connect 4 webcams to one pc and still get pictures from all of them
[05 Jan/08:36] <Big`Ed> anything is possible with the right dollars
[05 Jan/08:36] <jeper> i know taht 
[05 Jan/08:36] <jeper> but if i dont have the kind of money 
[05 Jan/08:37] <Big`Ed> but the cheaper you go, the harder it would be to do that
[05 Jan/08:37] <Big`Ed> ie. a standard $100 camera and basic win98
[05 Jan/08:37] <Big`Ed> it depends on the 'software' you are going to use to do it with
[05 Jan/08:37] <jeper> if we are talking tht kind of money it is no problem
[05 Jan/08:37] <Big`Ed> if it supports multiple inputs
[05 Jan/08:38] <Big`Ed> or if you have to run multiple instances of it
[05 Jan/08:38] <Big`Ed> that is where the money comes in
[05 Jan/08:38] <jeper> u know where to buy software like that 
[05 Jan/08:39] <Big`Ed> no - i have only messed with a single web cam software app
[05 Jan/08:39] <Big`Ed> that came with my camera
[05 Jan/08:39] <Big`Ed> but with scsi or usb you should be able to get 4 cameras functional at the same time on your PC
[05 Jan/08:40] <Big`Ed> i know i have 2 on mine that both work
[05 Jan/08:40] <jeper> cool 
[05 Jan/08:40] <jeper> thanks a lot 
[05 Jan/08:40] <Big`Ed> okies
[05 Jan/08:40] <Big`Ed> 3d porno cam's eh?
[05 Jan/08:41] <jeper> nope 
[05 Jan/08:41] <jeper> security 
[05 Jan/08:41] <Big`Ed> there is prob some security software that will 'frame' multiple inputs 
[05 Jan/08:41] <Big`Ed> into single signal

[05 Jan/11:52] <CJ^> keep it...
[05 Jan/11:53] <GooDoo> i need to dump it because my DSL is dependant on software that cant be installed on @k
[05 Jan/11:53] <CJ^> thast soo wrong...
[05 Jan/11:53] <GooDoo> my printer also has no NT4 or 2000 driver
[05 Jan/11:53] <CJ^> but win98 doesnt have those features of win2k...
[05 Jan/11:53] <CJ^> odd...

[05 Jan/12:55] <cdk17> when i try to view details right pane in explorer is blank
[05 Jan/12:55] <CJ^> under what directory???
[05 Jan/12:55] <cdk17> and i really dont want to reinstall windows but thats all i have left to try
[05 Jan/12:55] <cdk17> every directory
[05 Jan/12:55] <CJ^> cause if you have View as Web Page on  it may act that way
[05 Jan/12:55] <cdk17> nope

[05 Jan/12:58] <CJ^> well.. SOMEHTING you installed may have done this..
[05 Jan/12:58] <CJ^> but being its been several months.. you may not have even realised it
[05 Jan/12:58] <cdk17> the only thing i can think of is someone got in my system through a proggie like backorfice a while back and maybe he screwed with the registry
[05 Jan/12:58] <CJ^> duh

[05 Jan/13:09] > a^l^l^a^n!allan@mp-217-239-125.daxnet.no has joined #win98
[05 Jan/13:09] <a^l^l^a^n> hehe
[05 Jan/13:10] <a^l^l^a^n> thats what I call abuse of power
[05 Jan/13:10] <CJ^> no
[05 Jan/13:10] <a^l^l^a^n> yes, thats what I call it
[05 Jan/13:10] <CJ^> look.. we dont send files..
[05 Jan/13:11] <CJ^> we help those we can..
[05 Jan/13:11] <CJ^> and if YOU were stupid enough not to have a boot disk on hand.. its nto our fault...
[05 Jan/13:12] <a^l^l^a^n> maybe its not your fault, no, and maybe YOU don't send command.com, well u'll stop others from it too?
[05 Jan/13:12] <CJ^> yes   
[05 Jan/13:12] <CJ^> thats the channel rules..
[05 Jan/13:12] <CJ^> dont send files..
[05 Jan/13:13] <CJ^> NOW  if your sending files  and i dont know about.. i cant do much about it...
[05 Jan/13:13] <CJ^> but if you offer in channel  as an OP  i have to sstop that...
[05 Jan/13:13] <CJ^> thats teh channel rules..
[05 Jan/13:13] <a^l^l^a^n> strange rules, if it were warez, well I would have understood it, but command.com is free to distribute...
[05 Jan/13:14] <CJ^> no
[05 Jan/13:14] <CJ^> actually its not
[05 Jan/13:14] <a^l^l^a^n> and what is the purpose of the channel if not to help?
[05 Jan/13:14] <CJ^> its still MS property....
[05 Jan/13:14] <CJ^> we can help..
[05 Jan/13:14] <CJ^> but we dont have to send or allow the sending of files..
[05 Jan/13:14] <a^l^l^a^n> property is another thing
[05 Jan/13:14] <CJ^> command.com is nto freely distrubted..
[05 Jan/13:14] <a^l^l^a^n> yeah
[05 Jan/13:14] <CJ^> if it was www.bootdisk.com  would nto have been shut down...
[05 Jan/13:14] <CJ^> now..
[05 Jan/13:14] <CJ^> I agree..
[05 Jan/13:14] <CJ^> a boot disk is no big deal..
[05 Jan/13:15] <CJ^> and bootdisk.com got a raw deal...
[05 Jan/13:15] <CJ^> i dont see whats wwrong with it.. but i have to abide by it...
[05 Jan/13:15] <a^l^l^a^n> yes, and you didn't send any files....
[05 Jan/13:15] <a^l^l^a^n> and I didn't receive any
[05 Jan/13:15] <CJ^> nope  and i wont unless channel rules change...
[05 Jan/13:16] <CJ^> which they wont...
[05 Jan/13:16] <a^l^l^a^n> and so..... thanks for nothing....
[05 Jan/13:16] <CJ^> then  get out....  if ya dont like it....
[05 Jan/13:16] <a^l^l^a^n> hehe... I did'nt say that
[05 Jan/13:17] <CJ^> :P
[05 Jan/13:17] <CJ^> well ya have a problem with the channel rules though....
[05 Jan/13:17] <a^l^l^a^n> but I'll be gone, have a computer to format
[05 Jan/13:17] <a^l^l^a^n> yeah, and thats strange rules, I must say
[05 Jan/13:17] <CJ^> no..
[05 Jan/13:17] <CJ^> its following the law.... thats how the channel creator wants it...
[05 Jan/13:18] <CJ^> the files are intellectual property...
[05 Jan/13:18] <a^l^l^a^n> warez is fine to stop, but files to help people out is strange to stop
[05 Jan/13:18] <CJ^> and are protected by law.. not to be free distrubuted..
[05 Jan/13:18] <CJ^> no... 
[05 Jan/13:18] <CJ^> if i send you that file.. its warez....
[05 Jan/13:18] <CJ^> its not legal to do so...
[05 Jan/13:19] <a^l^l^a^n> heh.... why didn't you tell me about bootdisk.com for starters?
[05 Jan/13:19] <CJ^> if and when MS gets it through there head that some files are OK to distrubute... like a boot disk..  we will do that.
[05 Jan/13:19] <CJ^> well bootdisk.com is down..
[05 Jan/13:19] <CJ^> shutdown by MS...
[05 Jan/13:19] <a^l^l^a^n> nope
[05 Jan/13:19] <a^l^l^a^n> I'm there now
[05 Jan/13:19] <a^l^l^a^n> so it cant be
[05 Jan/13:20] <CJ^> well.. then MS let him keep going..
[05 Jan/13:20] <CJ^> BUT  ti was shutdown no too long ago...
[05 Jan/13:20] <a^l^l^a^n> and I'm downloading a bootdisk also, so that isnt correct
[05 Jan/13:20] <a^l^l^a^n> hmm
[05 Jan/13:21] <CJ^> MS shut down that site not too long ago..
[05 Jan/13:21] <CJ^> and asked him not to distrubte the ms boot disks
[05 Jan/13:21] <CJ^> NOW.. what your seeing on the site now..
[05 Jan/13:21] <CJ^> is nothing compared to what he USED to have...

[05 Jan/13:22] <a^l^l^a^n> hehe, well... the bootdisks is still there though
[05 Jan/13:22] @ mode #win98 [+v [gW]] by Vulcan!itsnotme@the.best.os.is.linux.am
[05 Jan/13:22] <CJ^> not all..
[05 Jan/13:22] <[gW]> can win98 be installed onto an extended partition?
[05 Jan/13:22] <CJ^> and if you notice  they arent MS bootdisks...
[05 Jan/13:23] <CJ^> yes GW  as long as the primamry is a dos/fat16/fat32 
[05 Jan/13:23] <a^l^l^a^n> no, theyre not, they're micro, and command.com is still required
[05 Jan/13:24] <CJ^> a^l^l^a^n  and they arent MS property then  are they?
[05 Jan/13:24] <CJ^> Micron paid for those... so  they can do what they want..
[05 Jan/13:24] <CJ^> and take the heat if MS gives them any....
[05 Jan/13:24] <a^l^l^a^n> well, I didn't ask for ms bootdisk, I asked for command.com
[05 Jan/13:25] <CJ^> ok.. no more arguing...  its channel rules...
[05 Jan/13:25] <[gW]> cj: lets say i have a 13 gig drive, and a 6 gig drive, the 13 gig is gonna have a dual boot of NT/98, but NT needs drive c to be fat16 in order to install NT, so what i was thinking is creating a PRImary of 2 gigs for NT, then an extended for FAT32, and copy the 6 gig drive to the extended, do you know if that would work?
[05 Jan/13:25] <a^l^l^a^n> ok...
[05 Jan/13:25] <CJ^> take it up with Big^ed....
[05 Jan/13:26] <CJ^> yes GW  it will
[05 Jan/13:26] <[gW]> super sweet
[05 Jan/13:26] <CJ^> but  its also recommended to install win98 then NT...
[05 Jan/13:26] <a^l^l^a^n> but, I think if a rule is wrong, it need to be corrected
[05 Jan/13:26] <[gW]> well
[05 Jan/13:27] <[gW]> im gonna install 98 first
[05 Jan/13:27] <a^l^l^a^n> but I'll be gone...
[05 Jan/13:27] <CJ^> no allan...
[05 Jan/13:27] <[gW]> but im just gonna copy it over to the hard drive
[05 Jan/13:27] <CJ^> now  dont liek it  leave...
[05 Jan/13:27] <[gW]> cuz i already have it on my other drive
[05 Jan/13:27] <a^l^l^a^n> and format my machine
[05 Jan/13:27] <CJ^> then go do so...
[05 Jan/13:27] <[gW]> would that still work?
[05 Jan/13:27] <[gW]> and would 98 be able to boot up if i set the partition to active?
[05 Jan/13:28] <a^l^l^a^n> thats another discussion, and people who follow rules without questioning them are stupid...
[05 Jan/13:28] <CJ^> hmm.. you may need to use ghost to copy them over....
[05 Jan/13:28] <CJ^> or  xcopy  
[05 Jan/13:28] <[gW]> but u dont no for sure?
[05 Jan/13:28] <[gW]> ihmmm
[05 Jan/13:28] <CJ^> a re-insatll is a better idea actually..
[05 Jan/13:28] <[gW]> unfortunately a re-install would take forever

[05 Jan/15:51] <Tara2x> Hello. Anyone here up for a very simple win98 networking question?
[05 Jan/15:51] <Big`Ed> boo - like what?
[05 Jan/15:51] <Big`Ed> Tara2x - like what?
[05 Jan/15:51] <Boo> I installed windows 98 on a new pc and it detects the serial ports but the mouse was never detected
[05 Jan/15:51] <SevensTX> What's up Tara?
[05 Jan/15:51] <Boo> it keeps saying there is no mouse on the beginning of windows
[05 Jan/15:51] <Tara2x> When networked peer-to-peer you can access a file on another computer...but can you run a program that is installed on that other system and not on yours?
[05 Jan/15:52] <Big`Ed> boo - are you saying pre-boot?
[05 Jan/15:52] <SevensTX> Tara - probably depends on the program
[05 Jan/15:52] * zhylum gets confused
[05 Jan/15:52] <Boo> big: what is a pre boot ?
[05 Jan/15:52] <zhylum> i have 2 autoexec.bat
[05 Jan/15:52] <Big`Ed> Tara2x - can you see/view files from both sides?
[05 Jan/15:52] <SevensTX> If it's client/server based, then yes. otherwise, you probably need to install it on your machine as well
[05 Jan/15:52] <Big`Ed> boo - your seeing this as the pc startsup - before windows98 kicks in?
[05 Jan/15:53] <Tara2x> Ah, I see. Thnx.

[05 Jan/15:56] <Boo> big : no
[05 Jan/15:57] <Big`Ed> boo - then 2 things to look at
[05 Jan/15:57] <Big`Ed> 1st, the BIOS
[05 Jan/15:57] <pyrokiwi> hmmm Boo do u hav a modem?
[05 Jan/15:57] <Big`Ed> to see if the comm ports are enabled
[05 Jan/15:57] <Boo> big : they are
[05 Jan/15:57] ! HigH|AwaY is known as HigHBabE
[05 Jan/15:57] <pyrokiwi> and check that ur modem is not using com1
[05 Jan/15:57] <Big`Ed> 2nd (if 1 does not work) is to see if the wire actually is hooked up to the motherboard
[05 Jan/15:57] <Big`Ed> and 3rd is what pyrokiwi said
[05 Jan/15:57] <Boo> big : I tried two mouses
[05 Jan/15:58] <Boo> big : I am sure there is no conflicts between modem and mouse
[05 Jan/15:58] <pyrokiwi>  ouch i just got a swimming pool toy diving weight thingy chucked at my head it hit me where my eyebrow is 
[05 Jan/15:58] <Big`Ed> boo - you checked cables?
[05 Jan/15:58] <Boo> big : could it be the mother board ?
[05 Jan/15:59] <Big`Ed> boo - motherboard serial ports can get fried - chances are VERY slim. - but if never worked, i would speculate wire's or bios first

[05 Jan/16:36] <Big`Ed> [19:31] <FreshBrew> i bought a new hard drive, and i installed it created it in fdisk and formatted, and  it doesnt work.. it corrupts all date loaded onto it
[05 Jan/16:36] <FreshBrew> like how what?
[05 Jan/16:36] <Big`Ed> didn't miss much LosGuy
[05 Jan/16:36] <FreshBrew> what do you mean?
[05 Jan/16:36] <FreshBrew> scan disk says its fine
[05 Jan/16:37] <Big`Ed> FreshBrew - what tells you the data is corrupt?
[05 Jan/16:37] ! Pslave^Nz is known as Powerslav
[05 Jan/16:38] <Kutron> BigEd that doesn't work :-(
[05 Jan/16:38] <FreshBrew> when i try and run any of the progs i load on.. it says THE FILE bgmain.exe (the baldurs gate exe file, for example) is corrupt, uninstall and reinstall and try again
[05 Jan/16:38] <FreshBrew> or it commits one of those insane microsfot illegal errors
[05 Jan/16:38] <Big`Ed> Kutron - right click on bar, go to VIEW, go to tool bar, go to 'quick launch' and check it
[05 Jan/16:39] <LosGuy> DMA enabled?
[05 Jan/16:39] <LosGuy> if so try disabling it
[05 Jan/16:39] <Big`Ed> FreshBrew - but a 'scandisk' is clean?
[05 Jan/16:39] <Kutron> BigEd I'm talking about taking a program that's already running, like mirc and drag to where the time is and task scheduler
[05 Jan/16:39] <FreshBrew> yeah.. as in no errors
[05 Jan/16:39] <FreshBrew> DMA?
[05 Jan/16:39] <FreshBrew> wich would be?
[05 Jan/16:40] <LosGuy> control panel / system / device manager click on the problem drive and choose properties
[05 Jan/16:40] <Big`Ed> is there any other operating system involved on this PC?
[05 Jan/16:40] <LosGuy> DMA direct memory access
[05 Jan/16:41] <FreshBrew> no
[05 Jan/16:41] * LosGuy wonders about a drive overlay too
[05 Jan/16:41] <LosGuy> is this the boot drive?
[05 Jan/16:41] <FreshBrew> i wish i knew how to use linux and had a copy but... no its my pri slave
[05 Jan/16:41] * LosGuy also wondered earlier about a VIRUS?
[05 Jan/16:41] <Kutron> BigEd I'm talking about taking a program that's already running, like mirc and drag to where the time is and task scheduler
[05 Jan/16:42] <Big`Ed> Kutron - oh - that is called the system tray
[05 Jan/16:42] <LosGuy> that is called the tray
[05 Jan/16:42] <LosGuy> and you cant easily add programs to the tray
[05 Jan/16:42] <LosGuy> except with a third party app
[05 Jan/16:42] <Big`Ed> Kutron - the program needs to be written to use that space
[05 Jan/16:42] <Kutron> are there any programs out there that let u add a program to it
[05 Jan/16:42] <Kutron> shit
[05 Jan/16:42] <Big`Ed> Kutron - you can try www.tucows.com for third
[05 Jan/16:42] <Big`Ed> but i don't know any
[05 Jan/16:42] <Kutron> thanks anyways
[05 Jan/16:42] <LosGuy> there is an app called minimize to tray I belive that might do what you want
[05 Jan/16:42] <LosGuy> no cussing

[05 Jan/17:59] <TurnIt> I'm putting together a Celeron 433 system on an Abit BM6 board, and the bios will detect the 15 gig IBM drive, but the next time I'm in bios, it thinks it's a 2.1 gigger
[05 Jan/17:59] <TurnIt> the jumpers are set right and everything
[05 Jan/17:59] <TurnIt> I even flashed the bios to the latest version (which was supposed to fix problems with the larger drives)
[05 Jan/18:00] <TurnIt> any ideas?
[05 Jan/18:00] * LosGuy has never seen that before
[05 Jan/18:00] <TurnIt> yeah, I've called around to several of my buds that do this sort of thing...
[05 Jan/18:00] <TurnIt> no clue from anyone
[05 Jan/18:01] <TurnIt> well, the only thing I've got is a suggestion to use a file management system from the hdd manufacturer, but I've heard win98 doesn't like that...
[05 Jan/18:01] <TurnIt> and...the bios is *supposed* to handle it
[05 Jan/18:01] <LosGuy> yuck
[05 Jan/18:01] <TurnIt> no kidding
[05 Jan/18:02] <LosGuy> win98 isnt the problem ..they just suck in general

[05 Jan/18:02] <LosGuy> what bios is this?
[05 Jan/18:03] <TurnIt> whatever the latest is for the bm6...d/l this afternoon to flash
[05 Jan/18:03] * LosGuy meant brand
[05 Jan/18:03] <CJ^> tried any other hdd on it yet??

[05 Jan/18:03] <LosGuy> AWARD
[05 Jan/18:03] <TurnIt> sorry, man
[05 Jan/18:04] <LosGuy> after detecting is it seeing the correct drive in the first page of bios?
[05 Jan/18:04] <TurnIt> nope, haven't tried another hdd
[05 Jan/18:04] <LosGuy> not the auto detect
[05 Jan/18:04] <TurnIt> yeah, but the next time I go into the bios, it's back to 2.1...
[05 Jan/18:04] <TurnIt> and I am saving it

[05 Jan/18:08] <TurnIt> thought it would just go right together...never had this much problem!
[05 Jan/18:11] <TurnIt> there are always quirks, but I have spent *way* more time on this than I had envisioned as worst case
[05 Jan/18:11] <pyrokiwi> hmmm yeh funny thing to happen
[05 Jan/18:12] <TurnIt> ok...well, I'll try the drive in my machine and see if it can "remember" that it's a 15 gig one
[05 Jan/18:12] <TurnIt> I had thought that the mainboard might have a prob?
[05 Jan/18:12] <TurnIt> what do you guys think about that theory?
[05 Jan/18:13] <pyrokiwi> hmmm maybe
[05 Jan/18:13] <pyrokiwi> there may be something at www.motherboards.org if it is a mb "fault" u may want to check it out

[05 Jan/18:14] <TurnIt> ok, sounds good
[05 Jan/18:17] <TurnIt> thanks guys.  I'll see if those suggestions get me anywhere.  I was just so sure the flash was going to do it when I saw that the latest version was a fix for large drives

[05 Jan/18:38] <kdsplace> I was wondering if I could dlete one file
[05 Jan/18:38] <LosGuy> what file?
[05 Jan/18:38] <kdsplace> Any file
[05 Jan/18:38] <LosGuy> oic
[05 Jan/18:39] <kdsplace> I have thisone file on my cd

[05 Jan/18:40] < CABlond!CJNordwall@azurite.Stanford.EDU has left #win98 ()
[05 Jan/18:40] <LosGuy> hmm let me check with someone that does have one.. if I can
[05 Jan/18:41] <Deton8R> uh, once a file is on the cd, it's usually there forever
[05 Jan/18:41] <Deton8R> except when it's a cdrw
[05 Jan/18:41] <Deton8R> in which case, you can erase it...but usually not delete a file

[05 Jan/18:41] <kdsplace> I have it on a cd rw

[05 Jan/18:42] <kdsplace> i know how one file is forever on cd r
[05 Jan/18:42] <kdsplace> But I want a file off a cd RW
[05 Jan/18:42] <LosGuy> what is the big deal... copy the cd to your HD and then try it
[05 Jan/18:42] <kdsplace> Its just one file
[05 Jan/18:42] <Deton8R> no, you can't
[05 Jan/18:42] <LosGuy> and if it dont work then burn it again on the cdrw without that file
[05 Jan/18:43] <kdsplace> If I do that, my hd will wear out
[05 Jan/18:44] <LosGuy> oh it will wear out eventually anyway... that should not do it by itself
[05 Jan/18:44] <LosGuy> I think it depends on the software you used and the way you formated the disk
[05 Jan/18:45] <LosGuy> a little birdy just told me that
[05 Jan/18:45] <kdsplace> oh really?
[05 Jan/18:45] <kdsplace> I thought the more files you put on it, the sooner it wears out

[05 Jan/22:58] <KNGFaisal> well Cj^ i m using Go!zilla for downloading.....i have Proxy sever too...but i dont know how to use it in proper way.
[05 Jan/22:58] <CJ^> the trick is  you are the sucker...
[05 Jan/22:58] <alyosha> this is MS, you fdon't mess with bill
[05 Jan/22:58] <CJ^> and i can tell you anythgin cause you believe it...   thats how its done...
[05 Jan/22:58] <CJ^> HA
[05 Jan/22:58] <CJ^> where the heck have you been...
[05 Jan/22:59] <alyosha> no I am asking questions so educate me
[05 Jan/22:59] <CJ^> pirates dont care..
[05 Jan/22:59] <CJ^> non
[05 Jan/22:59] <CJ^> no
[05 Jan/22:59] <CJ^> im not putting you down..
[05 Jan/22:59] <CJ^> i telling you what they think...
[05 Jan/22:59] <KNGFaisal> CJ^ ?
[05 Jan/22:59] <CJ^> they look at you as a sucker...
[05 Jan/22:59] <alyosha> these are not pirates
[05 Jan/22:59] <alyosha> these are all legit business
[05 Jan/22:59] <CJ^> KNGF  what proxy server??? MS proxy server??
[05 Jan/22:59] <CJ^> aly....
[05 Jan/22:59] <CJ^> go for it....
[05 Jan/22:59] <CJ^> have fun
[05 Jan/23:00] <CJ^> its a real copy   i know it is...
[05 Jan/23:00] <CJ^> BUT    its not a legal one...
[05 Jan/23:00] <alyosha> gp tp pricewatch.com
[05 Jan/23:00] <CJ^> <<< used to sell them till i got educated...
[05 Jan/23:00] <KNGFaisal> CJ^ nope its my "Internet Sevice providers" Proxy Server!
[05 Jan/23:00] <CJ^> dude... telling ya...
[05 Jan/23:00] <CJ^> >
[05 Jan/23:00] <alyosha> how are not legit if they are real?
[05 Jan/23:00] <CJ^> alyosha... i can make a copy of win98   
[05 Jan/23:00] <CJ^> its a real copy.. it works...
[05 Jan/23:00] <CJ^> but its illegal..
[05 Jan/23:00] <CJ^> NOW..
[05 Jan/23:01] <CJ^> what they do.. is buy bulk from say  Compaq....
[05 Jan/23:01] <CJ^> now  the trick is.. these are only to be sold WITH a compaq computer...
[05 Jan/23:01] <CJ^> but Compaq doesnt care..
[05 Jan/23:01] <KNGFaisal> CJ^ i think u r Damn Buzy!
[05 Jan/23:01] <CJ^> nothign stops them from selling it to say  MicroWay...
[05 Jan/23:02] <CJ^> KNGF   if you ISP has a proxy server  and you are having trouble with it.. call them...
[05 Jan/23:02] <CJ^> thats the best route...
[05 Jan/23:02] <alyosha> do you really think these guys would still be in biz with addresses and phone numbers and advertising on a major web page if they weren't.. MS would be all over them
[05 Jan/23:02] <CJ^> YES
[05 Jan/23:02] <CJ^> they would
[05 Jan/23:02] <alyosha> Microway?
[05 Jan/23:02] <CJ^> they do it all the time...
[05 Jan/23:02] <CJ^> thats the thing...
[05 Jan/23:02] <CJ^> yes Microway...
[05 Jan/23:02] <CJ^> very large legit re-seller..
[05 Jan/23:02] <alyosha> the dif is you do not get the manual the box or the tech support
[05 Jan/23:03] <KNGFaisal> CJ^ my ISP staff is Kidoo and they dont have experiance with Proxy! so i need a master of proxy settings.
[05 Jan/23:03] <CJ^> the diff.. is that its nto legal.. and they sell it to suckers all the time..
[05 Jan/23:03] <alyosha> but you get the certifacate and the disc
[05 Jan/23:03] <Los-Guy> just call 1(800)RULEGIT and ask em alyosha
[05 Jan/23:03] <CJ^> KNGF.. if they have a proxy  did they give you the settings to access teh Inet through it??
[05 Jan/23:04] <alyosha> why hasn't MS stopped them, bill does it all the time
[05 Jan/23:04] <CJ^> first thing they will ask you for is the number off the manual alyosha
[05 Jan/23:04] <CJ^> they do stop them alyosha..
[05 Jan/23:04] <CJ^> they do
[05 Jan/23:04] <CJ^> it takes time and money
[05 Jan/23:04] <KNGFaisal> CJ^ yeah i have settings... but can i use it for Downloading....fast downloading?
[05 Jan/23:04] <CJ^> the gov steps in..
[05 Jan/23:04] <CJ^> its not a small legal matter..
[05 Jan/23:04] <alyosha> when ever you buy oem you can't call MS anyway you have to call the manufactuer
[05 Jan/23:05] <CJ^> at $250,000 a pop  per copy.. its a high stakes felony
[05 Jan/23:05] <CJ^> NO
[05 Jan/23:05] <CJ^> you dont 
[05 Jan/23:05] <CJ^> there are many versions of OEM...
[05 Jan/23:05] <CJ^> KNGF  yes
[05 Jan/23:05] <alyosha> when I bought my puter it came with windows and when I called ms they said call hp
[05 Jan/23:05] <CJ^> those settings are just for you to plug into whatever app you need to use that can access the Inte through Proxy...
[05 Jan/23:05] <CJ^> right alyosha..
[05 Jan/23:05] <CJ^> BUT
[05 Jan/23:06] <CJ^> thats HP's OEM...
[05 Jan/23:06] <alyosha> but?
[05 Jan/23:06] <CJ^> see..
[05 Jan/23:06] <alyosha> these are oem from Hard Drives
[05 Jan/23:06] <CJ^> i can buy OEM froma re-seller...
[05 Jan/23:06] <alyosha> and?
[05 Jan/23:06] <CJ^> there are many versions of OEM...
[05 Jan/23:06] <CJ^> you arent aware...
[05 Jan/23:06] <CJ^> ive been there on both sides.. \
[05 Jan/23:06] <CJ^> buying and sellign 
[05 Jan/23:07] <KNGFaisal> CJ^ i c 
[05 Jan/23:07] <KNGFaisal> CJ^ thanx ...lemme try!
[05 Jan/23:07] <alyosha> so if I own win3.1 and trash my old computer I still can use 3.1 on my new computer
[05 Jan/23:07] <CJ^> KNGF  all ya need to do is plug inthe proxy settings  if the app supports it.. and your ok...
[05 Jan/23:07] <CJ^> yes alyosha
[05 Jan/23:07] <CJ^> you paid for it..
[05 Jan/23:08] <CJ^> ouy can use it any ONE computer...
[05 Jan/23:08] <alyosha> right
[05 Jan/23:11] <CJ^> a single computer at a time...
[05 Jan/23:11] <alyosha> so if these oem's aren't used what's the dif?
[05 Jan/23:11] <CJ^> it breaks the aggreement between MS and the OEM that made them....
[05 Jan/23:11] <alyosha> IOW if the computers are trashed or used for parts why can't I use the OEM
[05 Jan/23:11] <KNGFaisal> hmmm
[05 Jan/23:11] <CJ^> if you call 1-800rulegit  and ask tehm.. they can explain whats right and wrong....

[06 Jan/11:59] <CJ^> you'll see a list of apps that start up when windows starts..
[06 Jan/12:00] <CJ^> Norton will be in there
[06 Jan/12:00] <Will_M> it loads before the startup programs do
[06 Jan/12:00] <CJ^> uncheck the box next to it
[06 Jan/12:00] <CJ^> then check in the autoexec.bat and config.sys
[06 Jan/12:00] <Will_M> the only norton ones are the virus checker and utilities
[06 Jan/12:02] > wez!not@steve.protocom.com has joined #win98
[06 Jan/12:02] <Will_M> checked both of those as well teh only reference I see of norton is the navds which checks for virii when win loads
[06 Jan/12:02] <CJ^> the utilities loads norton crash guard as well
[06 Jan/12:03] <Will_M> navdx
[06 Jan/12:05] <Will_M> that is the crash guard enabler which modifies the ctrl+alt+del screen so include freeze-check and anti-freeze, it then uses the VxD
[06 Jan/12:06] <Will_M> but as I said before the VxD loads before that program has a chance to
[06 Jan/12:08] <Will_M> and I have disabled Crash Guard in the startup previously to no avail, the Vxd loads seperately from it
[06 Jan/12:09] <CJ^> well have ya tried uniinstalling Norton...
[06 Jan/12:09] <CJ^> erpsonally norton crash guard causes crashes  
[06 Jan/12:10] <Will_M> that I have not done, because the only option to uninstall is the entire systemworks 2.0 suite, no individual components
[06 Jan/12:13] > smogg!Fuze@TULSB102-03.splitrock.net has joined #win98

[06 Jan/12:15] <CJ^> a lot are needed

[06 Jan/12:56] <CJ^> hey dd
[06 Jan/12:56] <CJ^> yeah  see there isnt anything on the MS site reffering to data tables...
[06 Jan/12:56] <devilDigg> whats up cj?
[06 Jan/12:56] <devilDigg> i just came from buying a system
[06 Jan/12:56] <CJ^> the Media Ring application is the fault
[06 Jan/12:56] <CJ^> its the one nto updating the correct area code for itself.. nto win98
[06 Jan/12:57] <skoolbrat> CJ^:  They say that there program uses "the windows data tables for dialling".  
[06 Jan/12:58] <skoolbrat> CJ^:  Is there something in Win98 which lists the world's dialling codes?
[06 Jan/12:59] <CJ^> they are syaing its looking at the coutry or region code in DUN
[06 Jan/13:00] <skoolbrat> CJ^:  The code for dialling out of the country.  ie international access code.  It used to be 009, now its just 00
[06 Jan/13:03] <CJ^> hmm

[06 Jan/13:03] <CJ^> the help db isnt making sense of this...
[06 Jan/13:03] <CJ^> now i under stand what yer saying...
[06 Jan/13:03] <CJ^> but...
[06 Jan/13:03] <CJ^> how to change or amend that... thats a differnt issue
[06 Jan/13:03] <spazztik> i have two windows machines networked to each other how can i get one to share its printer with the others?
[06 Jan/13:03] <skoolbrat> CJ^:  Glad it's not just me that is having trouble with this :)
[06 Jan/13:04] <CJ^> well.. see MS doens seem to address this...
[06 Jan/13:04] <CJ^> now.. the only thin i can suggest  is putting in the information manually to the DUN properties for the dial up you have
[06 Jan/13:05] <spazztik> ideas any one?
[06 Jan/13:05] <skoolbrat> CJ^: Unfortunately Media Ring just adds the numbers 009 in front of any other numbers.  It's too smart for its own good.
[06 Jan/13:06] <CJ^> spazz
[06 Jan/13:06] <CJ^> file and print sharing
[06 Jan/13:06] <CJ^> skool  see thats where i think its the media ring app thats at fault...
[06 Jan/13:06] <CJ^> spazz if you have file and print sharing enabled...
[06 Jan/13:07] <CJ^> you can share it

[06 Jan/13:09] <CJ^> i dont think it is...
[06 Jan/13:09] <CJ^> maybe a callt o MS tech suport would help...
[06 Jan/13:09] <COO-MAN> outlook express under options has "make oe my default email reader", when I hit it, it goes gray like it took it, hit 'OK' and then when you go back into it again, it is back to nonactive.

[06 Jan/13:12] <CJ^> yeah if they did yes

[06 Jan/13:22] <Trailfaz> I'm using Autocad14 at work and when I load it up and load thru the drawings , it just seems slow loading the drawings

[06 Jan/13:22] < SignOff: COO-MAN!noneof@208.10.222.36 (Leaving)
[06 Jan/13:22] <CJ^> and UNLOAD anything yu have in memory currently...
[06 Jan/13:22] <CJ^> and more memory always helps
[06 Jan/13:22] <Trailfaz> i do that every morning when i get in, but i just do a quick scandisk
[06 Jan/13:22] <Trailfaz> i have 32 megs or ram at work
[06 Jan/13:22] <Trailfaz> when i run scandisk i don't do the thorough scan
[06 Jan/13:23] <CJ^> well dfrag will help
[06 Jan/13:23] <Trailfaz> i just run standard
[06 Jan/13:23] <CJ^> let it run defrag.. and dont toucvh it  
[06 Jan/13:23] <CJ^> just let it run
[06 Jan/13:23] <Trailfaz> i do
[06 Jan/13:24] <Trailfaz> but i pick the one where it just checks for errors because the other option will just take the whole day
[06 Jan/13:24] <Trailfaz> will that help it by picking the basic option ?
[06 Jan/13:24] <Trailfaz> i do it every morning & sometimes after work
[06 Jan/13:24] <CJ^> do the full defrag..
[06 Jan/13:24] <Trailfaz> and also I clean out the windows temp folder
[06 Jan/13:24] <CJ^> let it run till its done..
[06 Jan/13:25] <CJ^> even if it takes all day
[06 Jan/13:25] <Trailfaz> but i have to use autocad 14
[06 Jan/13:25] <Trailfaz> it's going to affect the defrag right >
[06 Jan/13:25] <CJ^> autocad??
[06 Jan/13:25] <Trailfaz> ?
[06 Jan/13:25] <CJ^> on only 32mb?

[06 Jan/13:27] <Trailfaz> but the hard drive i have installed is like kind of slow and choppy at times
[06 Jan/13:28] <Trailfaz> i guess the only way to quicken it up and run smoothly is to run defrag full and scandisk
[06 Jan/13:28] <CJ^> Wrice  whoever told ya that... is blowing smoke
[06 Jan/13:28] <CJ^> Traill.. best bet

[06 Jan/13:32] <Trailfaz> it just sits there until i go to push the off button myself

[06 Jan/13:33] <Trailfaz> isn't there a way to make it shutdown automatically all the time instead of it doing that ?
[06 Jan/13:33] <CJ^> er disable..
[06 Jan/13:33] <CJ^> and turn off power managemnt
[06 Jan/13:33] <Trailfaz> where can i find that ?
[06 Jan/13:33] <CJ^> start>run>msconfig
[06 Jan/13:33] <Trailfaz> i dont' get the message it is now safe to turn your computer off
[06 Jan/13:34] <Trailfaz> it just goes fuzzy and then it locks up
[06 Jan/13:34] <lurkapup> if Ive installed win2k onto the same drive as win98 and the ie5 has been overwritten so things like outlook wont work in 98 how can I get it back to the 98 version ?
[06 Jan/13:34] <CJ^> someone play with the logos?
[06 Jan/13:34] <Trailfaz> what?
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> lurk  you upgraded win98 to win2k?
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> Trail.. the logo
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> the shutdown logo...
[06 Jan/13:35] <lurkapup> umm no I did a dual install ..
[06 Jan/13:35] <Trailfaz> oh ok
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> if someone messed with it.. it may nto appear
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> lurk
[06 Jan/13:35] <Trailfaz> no i don't think so
[06 Jan/13:35] <Trailfaz> no no one messed with it
[06 Jan/13:35] <lurkapup> got them both running .. but it seems to have screwed a few things in 98
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> lurk.. then the two are kept seperate...
[06 Jan/13:35] <Trailfaz> it just gives me a fuzzy dark screen after i click on shutdown
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> odd...
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> well try disabling fast shutdown...
[06 Jan/13:35] <Trailfaz> ok
[06 Jan/13:35] <lurkapup> mm ok - was kinda hoping that was my prob - cause now outlook gives a cant load msoe.dll error
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> and disable power managemnt
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> might help
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> if it was 98 SE
[06 Jan/13:35] <CJ^> id say get eh shutdown patch
[06 Jan/13:36] <lurkapup> figured that since there is only one ie dir
[06 Jan/13:36] <Trailfaz> then it should prevent that from happening again ?
[06 Jan/13:36] <CJ^> hmmm
[06 Jan/13:36] <CJ^> yeah  that IS true..
[06 Jan/13:36] <Trailfaz> i mean after a while it gets annoying you know having to wait for it to shutdown and then it doesn't then you get that message the next day
[06 Jan/13:37] <CJ^> yeah trail i hear ya on that
[06 Jan/13:37] <CJ^> hmm
[06 Jan/13:37] <lurkapup> I cant reinstall ie5 .. or outlook (same thing isnt it ? ) cause I keep gettn an error saying a newer version already exists ..
[06 Jan/13:37] <CJ^> lurk...  its SUPPOSED to install seperatly...
[06 Jan/13:37] <CJ^> supposed to
[06 Jan/13:37] <lurkapup> :)
[06 Jan/13:37] <CJ^> but  heck its the beta...
[06 Jan/13:37] <Trailfaz> i mean after a while wouldn't the computer start to have more errors if it keeps up like that ?
[06 Jan/13:37] <lurkapup> yup thats always a point :)
[06 Jan/13:37] <Trailfaz> not shutting down properly ?

[06 Jan/13:41] <CJ^> it stops it from shutting down too quickly

[06 Jan/13:53] <Gentle--> can I run a system with 133 mhz ram which only needs 100 mhz ram?
[06 Jan/13:54] <CJ^> well  you shoudl be able to... but  whats that got to do with 98?
[06 Jan/13:54] <CJ^> thats a hardware issue...
[06 Jan/13:54] <Gentle--> so...?
[06 Jan/13:54] <mrgone> my 100mhz bus works with 66 
[06 Jan/13:55] <CJ^> i would suspect thoguh that  pc133 ram may be touchy on a mb that doesnt support it fully..

[06 Jan/13:55] <devilDigg> hi mrgone
[06 Jan/13:56] <Kawi> here's my problem when I restart windows I get these tmp files in windows directory, the more I restart the more I get (the temps look like product keys) is there a way to find out where a temp file is coming from?
[06 Jan/13:56] <devilDigg> unless you get pc133 ram
[06 Jan/13:56] <CJ^> er no dd
[06 Jan/13:56] <CJ^> only if the system supports pc133  and can use it
[06 Jan/13:56] <CJ^> will he get to use the full 133
[06 Jan/13:56] <CJ^> i dont see a reason why it wont work   just wont be at 133
[06 Jan/13:56] <Gentle--> I realise the 133 would be wasted if I only ran it at 100 but it would work right?
[06 Jan/13:56] <CJ^> it may Gentle...
[06 Jan/13:56] <CJ^> no guarantee
[06 Jan/13:57] <CJ^> check the mb website
[06 Jan/13:57] <Kawi> I have 100 running with 66 but they all run at 66
[06 Jan/13:57] <CJ^> they shoudl have the correct info there
[06 Jan/13:57] <Kawi> What kinda mb are you using
[06 Jan/13:57] <Gentle--> I know that the m/b only runs at 66 or 100

[06 Jan/14:00] <Gentle--> thanks.
[06 Jan/14:01] * Kawi asks so anyone have an idea for my prob?
[06 Jan/14:02] <wez> check your startup file for some install progs, and your autoexec.bat
[06 Jan/14:03] <wez> and if you dont see anything in there..... major virus scan?
[06 Jan/14:03] <Kawi> there's nothing in autoexec nothing in the startup and no virus

[06 Jan/14:03] <wez> when did this start?

[06 Jan/18:51] <LosGuy> what proxy?
[06 Jan/18:52] <LosGuy> MS proxy? or are you using NAT? 
[06 Jan/18:52] <EriX> i have try it but it not work
[06 Jan/18:52] <EriX> i use sygate
[06 Jan/18:53] <LosGuy> k that is not a proxy it is NAT
[06 Jan/18:53] <LosGuy> but how do you have your network set up?
[06 Jan/18:53] <LosGuy> you need a working TCP / IP network
[06 Jan/18:53] <EriX> ok
[06 Jan/18:54] ! Spybrb is known as SpyderB8
[06 Jan/18:54] <LosGuy> you should have the gateway on the client set to the IP of the host
[06 Jan/18:54] <EriX> how to configure it
[06 Jan/18:54] <EriX> on ie
[06 Jan/18:54] <LosGuy> it works easier if you use dynamic IPs on the client and static  on the host
[06 Jan/18:54] <LosGuy> there is nothing to configure on IE
[06 Jan/18:54] <LosGuy> just get a working network
[06 Jan/18:55] <LosGuy> and tell the computer that you connect to the internet via a LAN
[06 Jan/18:55] <EriX> in ona lan
[06 Jan/18:55] <EriX> im on a lan

[06 Jan/19:30] <Alyson> Whatever you do, don't upgrade to win 2k.
[06 Jan/19:30] <LosGuy> why would you
[06 Jan/19:30] <LosGuy> this is a win98 channel... win2k is basicly NT5
[06 Jan/19:30] <CJ^> Win2k is a great OS...
[06 Jan/19:30] <Alyson> Because I was stupid
[06 Jan/19:30] <CJ^> it not really meant for win98 -win2k upgrades  but it supports it
[06 Jan/19:31] <Alyson> I upgraded from 98 today and now almost all of my applications are non functional.
[06 Jan/19:31] <CJ^> but  then again... you have a beta still right????
[06 Jan/19:31] <Alyson> nope
[06 Jan/19:31] <Jessica-> win2k comes out in Feb
[06 Jan/19:31] <Alyson> this is the final one.
[06 Jan/19:31] <CJ^> well a lot of apps dont meet win2k req...
[06 Jan/19:31] <LosGuy> uh
[06 Jan/19:31] <CJ^> some nned patches 
[06 Jan/19:31] <CJ^> others need total overhauls...
[06 Jan/19:32] <CJ^> but  again.. it wanst made to be a consumer os..
[06 Jan/19:32] <Alyson> My tv adaptor , my camera, and my dvd player. All non functional.
[06 Jan/19:32] <CJ^> but i didnt have trouble with most of my apps....
[06 Jan/19:32] <CJ^> well.. those are hardware
[06 Jan/19:32] <Alyson> Anything without a signature won't work.
[06 Jan/19:32] <CJ^> gotta wait till win2k drivers are released...
[06 Jan/19:32] <LosGuy> blame your hardware manufacturers

[06 Jan/19:32] <Alyson> I can't even back it up to 95. It needs dos mode to do that. I don't have dos on 2000
[06 Jan/19:33] <CJ^> and yer a beta tester?  or how did you get the final product?
[06 Jan/19:33] <Alyson> office
[06 Jan/19:33] <CJ^> NT never had DOS...
[06 Jan/19:33] <Alyson> I know
[06 Jan/19:33] <CJ^> office works in win2k...
[06 Jan/19:33] <CJ^> office 97 works
[06 Jan/19:33] <Alyson> I didn't think this would happen.

[06 Jan/19:34] <Alyson> nevermind office. I try to install the drivers again and tell them to override the signature and they can't even finid the drivers.
[06 Jan/19:35] <CJ^> cause  if the drivers arent signed they may not work...
[06 Jan/19:35] <CJ^> thats the point of signatures...
[06 Jan/19:35] <CJ^> its supposed to help tech support track bugs with drivers...
[06 Jan/19:35] <Alyson> I know.
[06 Jan/19:35] <CJ^> and help the OS track files if they become corrupted...
[06 Jan/19:35] <CJ^> well... if ya KNEW all this...
[06 Jan/19:36] <Alyson> These are critical programs for me. I can't use anything now.
[06 Jan/19:36] <CJ^> still id report it back to MS anyways
[06 Jan/19:36] <CJ^> cause upgrades from win98 to win2k were tested

[06 Jan/19:38] <CJ^> why not?

[06 Jan/20:45] <LosGuy> heck you can get 128mb for about that much on pricewatch
[06 Jan/20:45] <Cat`Woman> I suppose I entered too late in the conversation, but did I here someone say upgrade to a 266???
[06 Jan/20:45] <pyrokiwi> actually 64 ram cost more then 100us
[06 Jan/20:45] <Cat`Woman> kawi, where are you?
[06 Jan/20:45] <pyrokiwi> i hav p166 :)
[06 Jan/20:45] <Kawi> Cornwall Ontario
[06 Jan/20:46] <Cat`Woman> pyro, that will do you for a very little while longer
[06 Jan/20:46] <Cat`Woman> are you still running 95 or 98?
[06 Jan/20:46] <pyrokiwi> hmmm nz costs more then us 4 hardware
[06 Jan/20:46] <pyrokiwi> 98 works fine cause hav fat32 hdrive
[06 Jan/20:46] <pyrokiwi> fat32 13gig hdrive is only good thing
[06 Jan/20:46] <Cat`Woman> well, you will get better speed if you run 95
[06 Jan/20:46] <Kawi> but 98 is better than 95 :)
[06 Jan/20:46] <pyrokiwi> yeh but 95 doesnt support 13gig hdrive
[06 Jan/20:46] <Cat`Woman> trust me, I work on 166's all day at work (they are always breaking)
[06 Jan/20:47] ! Pslave^Nz is known as Powerslav
[06 Jan/20:47] <pyrokiwi> lol mine is p166mmx 32ram (1-dimm) 13gig hdrive
[06 Jan/20:47] <pyrokiwi> so it is better then a lot
[06 Jan/20:47] <Cat`Woman> win95b (osr2) does
[06 Jan/20:47] <pyrokiwi> yeh but we dont hav
[06 Jan/20:47] <pyrokiwi> anyway i want win98
[06 Jan/20:48] <Cat`Woman> minimally you should pickup a stick of 32meg ram
[06 Jan/20:48] <Kawi> for sure easier to do the simple things and I love easier :)
[06 Jan/20:48] <Cat`Woman> you should be able to do that for 40bucks
[06 Jan/20:48] <pyrokiwi> i think our p166 chip is one of the best cause there was a ride range of them and ours was one of the latest
[06 Jan/20:48] <pyrokiwi> 40bucks us?
[06 Jan/20:48] <pyrokiwi> where from
[06 Jan/20:48] <pyrokiwi> in nz it is EXPENSIVE
[06 Jan/20:48] <Cat`Woman> order it online
[06 Jan/20:48] <pyrokiwi> where from?
[06 Jan/20:49] <Cat`Woman> www.pricewatch.com check it out
[06 Jan/20:49] <Cat`Woman> you will have to arrange international shipping but you can do it
[06 Jan/20:50] <Cat`Woman> or you can send me money and I will send you some ;)
[06 Jan/20:50] <pyrokiwi> lol but how much shipping?
[06 Jan/20:50] <Kawi> I hope I get a job in the states when I'm finished school money is worth more and prices are much nicer :)
[06 Jan/20:50] <pyrokiwi> yeh
[06 Jan/20:50] <pyrokiwi> i wanna live in nz
[06 Jan/20:50] <Cat`Woman> if you don't mind waiting a little while it would cost about $20.00 us postal
[06 Jan/20:51] <Cat`Woman> i like it here
[06 Jan/20:51] <pyrokiwi> hmmmm that is 120kiwi altogether
[06 Jan/20:51] <Kawi> I couldn't believe the price difference when I got the conputer shoppers mag
[06 Jan/20:51] <Cat`Woman> heh?
[06 Jan/20:51] <Cat`Woman> that is for 64
[06 Jan/20:51] <pyrokiwi> 4 64 more hmmm
[06 Jan/20:51] <Cat`Woman> you only need anohter 32 if you are running a 166, much more than that wont help
[06 Jan/20:52] <pyrokiwi> hav to talk to dad and look at stuff
[06 Jan/20:52] <pyrokiwi> yeh i need another 32
[06 Jan/20:52] <Cat`Woman> i think you could do it all for under $60.00 us dollars
[06 Jan/20:52] <pyrokiwi> hmmm that is 120kiwi
[06 Jan/20:52] <Cat`Woman> 120kiwi (I didn't get that part sorry)

[07 Jan/08:52] <devilDigg> unless the 2nd partition is win98 then i dont know
[07 Jan/08:52] <devilDigg> you would have to make your own boot.ini

[07 Jan/09:19] <DaRkThInG> i'll have to give that a try when i get back up to school..
[07 Jan/09:19] <DaRkThInG> will i have to reinstall all the drivers?
[07 Jan/09:19] <Azmodan> you may have to install some but certainly not all
[07 Jan/09:19] <DaRkThInG> ok...thats cool..
[07 Jan/09:19] <Azmodan> things like sound and video should be kewl
[07 Jan/09:20] <DaRkThInG> well i've traced my modem problems back to when i had a bad harddrive, got the new one and restored a backup..
[07 Jan/09:20] <DaRkThInG> and then the probs started, so something is corrupt
[07 Jan/09:20] <Azmodan> k
[07 Jan/09:20] <Azmodan> thought of just running SFC?
[07 Jan/09:20] <DaRkThInG> yah..
[07 Jan/09:21] <DaRkThInG> it finds a few files :P
[07 Jan/09:21] <Azmodan> k
[07 Jan/09:21] <DaRkThInG> i haven't replaced them all..
[07 Jan/09:21] <DaRkThInG> i guess that might be a good idea..
[07 Jan/09:21] <Azmodan> I would say so
[07 Jan/09:22] <DaRkThInG> i don't have the cd but the cabs are on my hd, i guess that will suffice.
[07 Jan/09:23] <Azmodan> it sure will
[07 Jan/09:24] <DaRkThInG> uninst.exe in c:\windows date changed..
[07 Jan/09:24] <DaRkThInG> should I just restore everything?
[07 Jan/09:26] <DaRkThInG> lol i haven't messed with this because i know i will restore something I didn't need to..

[07 Jan/10:55] <kdsplace> 3.0
[07 Jan/10:55] <CJ^> ok..
[07 Jan/10:55] <CJ^> that may be the issue...
[07 Jan/10:55] <CJ^> might want to see if you can upgrade it to 4.0
[07 Jan/10:55] <CJ^> or check out Nero
[07 Jan/10:56] <kdsplace> nero, where can i get that?
[07 Jan/10:56] <CJ^> download.com
[07 Jan/10:56] <kdsplace> cool
[07 Jan/10:56] <CJ^> there is a demo version there.
[07 Jan/10:56] <kdsplace> is it freeware?
[07 Jan/10:57] <CJ^> but it has a link to the manuafacture
[07 Jan/10:57] <CJ^> no

[07 Jan/11:33] <walkndude> hi
[07 Jan/11:34] <namehere> occasionally, windows boots to a black screen protection error, I have tracked this down to the irq for my scsi adapter changing from 12 to 3 for no apparent reason, does anyone know why this would happen?
[07 Jan/11:34] <CJ^> what SCSI adapter?
[07 Jan/11:35] <namehere> adaptec 2904 ( not 2940 ) a cheap one used for single devices, I have a cdr attached
[07 Jan/11:35] <devilDigg> woudl it be smart to overclock my p2 400 mhz?
[07 Jan/11:35] <CJ^> namehere ok  PCI or ISA?
[07 Jan/11:35] < wez!not@steve.protocom.com has left #win98 ()
[07 Jan/11:36] <walkndude> prob wouldn't hurt anything if you keep it cool 
[07 Jan/11:37] <namehere> pci - just another point , on rare occasions, windows will also redetect my monitor, an set it as a general pnp ?
[07 Jan/11:37] <Kawi> I woudln't but that's me
[07 Jan/11:37] <Kawi> just don't go crazy on it :)
[07 Jan/11:37] <CJ^> namehere.. if its PCI  then the IRQ will dance...
[07 Jan/11:37] <devilDigg> kawi: to me?
[07 Jan/11:37] <CJ^> PnP and all...
[07 Jan/11:38] <walkndude> I hear they aren't the best for overclocking
[07 Jan/11:38] <devilDigg> oh.. i know the celeron 300a is good to overclock
[07 Jan/11:38] <namehere> CJ^ can I disable pnp detection when booting ?
[07 Jan/11:38] <devilDigg> and that it can run at 450mhz
[07 Jan/11:38] <CJ^> go in the BIOS
[07 Jan/11:38] <CJ^> tell it NoN-PnP OS
[07 Jan/11:39] <CJ^> that should help
[07 Jan/11:39] <walkndude> I had a problem like that once , I think I ended up getting updated device drivers for the MB
[07 Jan/11:39] <CJ^> that could help also...
[07 Jan/11:39] <namehere> okay, so enable pnp os for setup, then disable to try and fix a set of working settings?
[07 Jan/11:40] ! HigH_AwaY is known as HigHBabE
[07 Jan/11:40] <devilDigg> i know they arent now:
[07 Jan/11:40] <devilDigg> Operating these processors at a bus frequency other than 100 MHz may void the warranty. 
[07 Jan/11:40] <devilDigg> from intel.com
[07 Jan/11:41] <CJ^> name  you can disable PnP in the bios perm
[07 Jan/11:41] <CJ^> its nto really going to affect much in teh way 98 operates..
[07 Jan/11:41] <namehere> okay, thanks - I'll try that :) 
[07 Jan/11:41] <CJ^> cept it does tend to settle the IRQ jumps some cards go through
[07 Jan/11:42] <walkndude> might try to disable IRQ Steering also.......
[07 Jan/11:42] <namehere> CJ^ I think I may have enabled that a couple of months ago, when I changed back from linux
[07 Jan/11:43] <CJ^> well  i would look to see whats goign on in the device manager
[07 Jan/11:43] <CJ^> also chekc the SCSI bios to see if the IRQ is set there as well..

[07 Jan/11:46] <walkndude> SCSI can be fun at times
[07 Jan/11:47] <CJ^> never have the problems with scsi that i do with IDE...
[07 Jan/11:47] <CJ^> like this scsi burner i have...
[07 Jan/11:47] <CJ^> i can do 4x burns.. np
[07 Jan/11:47] <CJ^> IDE bruners on teh other hand...:PP
[07 Jan/11:48] <CJ^> hardly ever
[07 Jan/11:48] <walkndude> I did a few times but with S7 boards mainly
[07 Jan/11:48] <CJ^> yeah well those can be touchy with teh ALi5  and VIA chipsets..
[07 Jan/11:48] <walkndude> but new drivers fixed the problem
[07 Jan/11:48] <CJ^> and dont even go into the SiS crap
[07 Jan/11:49] <walkndude> VIA..I think has got most of the bugs out now
[07 Jan/11:49] <CJ^> seems so
[07 Jan/11:49] <CJ^> at least they dont have issue with Higher end AGP cards
[07 Jan/11:49] <CJ^> lest not that ive really seen
[07 Jan/11:49] <CJ^> just the AGP driver at times...
[07 Jan/11:50] <walkndude> SIG had a fix before the new VIA drivers came out..it was only a 6 page easy fix
[07 Jan/11:51] <devilDigg> cj did you install linux /w win98 installed?
[07 Jan/11:51] <devilDigg> and what video card do you have?
[07 Jan/11:51] <CJ^> yeap
[07 Jan/11:51] <CJ^> win98 and rh 6.1 dual boot
[07 Jan/11:51] <CJ^> also did Corel and SuSE
[07 Jan/11:51] <devilDigg> ok
[07 Jan/11:51] <CJ^> on an TNT2
[07 Jan/11:51] <devilDigg> oh..
[07 Jan/11:51] <CJ^> works great
[07 Jan/11:51] <devilDigg> because i have a voodoo3 3000 and i dont have the drivers for it
[07 Jan/11:52] <devilDigg> or for my burner, or dvd, or anything else including sound for linux
[07 Jan/11:52] <CJ^> RH6.1 shoudl see it...
[07 Jan/11:52] <walkndude> is the disk access a lot faster in Linux?
[07 Jan/11:52] <CJ^> burner will be seen with a burn app
[07 Jan/11:52] <CJ^> try Gtoaster
[07 Jan/11:52] <CJ^> hmm...
[07 Jan/11:52] <CJ^> seems so...
[07 Jan/11:52] <devilDigg> ok no problem
[07 Jan/11:52] <CJ^> but  its hte GUI that is faster really...
[07 Jan/11:52] <devilDigg> i got a sound blaster live

[07 Jan/11:52] <CJ^> dude

[07 Jan/11:53] <CJ^> thats works
[07 Jan/11:53] <devilDigg> ok cool

[07 Jan/11:59] <DaDsMoOtH> haha...well...thought i just did.  :)
[07 Jan/11:59] <CJ^> well.. whats conflicting?
[07 Jan/12:00] <DaDsMoOtH> All i know is that some pieces of hardware are using the same irq
[07 Jan/12:00] <CJ^> ok.. what hardware?
[07 Jan/12:00] <CJ^> and is it causing major issues?
[07 Jan/12:00] <CJ^> cause IRQ sharing is normal....
[07 Jan/12:00] <DaDsMoOtH> I believe it's a major issue...and i'll type out what's using what.
[07 Jan/12:04] <DaDsMoOtH> 'Creative SB Live! Value' 'intel 82371AB/EB PCI to USB Universal Host Controller' and 'IRQ holder for PCI Steering' are all using irq #05
[07 Jan/12:04] <devilDigg> oh :(
[07 Jan/12:05] <CJ^> the SBLive is using IRQ5 for DOS/Legacy mode
[07 Jan/12:05] <CJ^> but thats the smae thign i have
[07 Jan/12:05] <CJ^> what i did was remove the DOS/legacy driver
[07 Jan/12:05] <devilDigg> i have it using irq 11
[07 Jan/12:05] <CJ^> so do i DD
[07 Jan/12:05] <CJ^> but the SBLive will use IRQ 5 for DOS/Legacy
[07 Jan/12:06] <devilDigg> oh
[07 Jan/12:06] <CJ^> all he needs to do it unload the DOS driver
[07 Jan/12:06] <devilDigg> oh yeah.. in the boot up
[07 Jan/12:06] <devilDigg> thats true
[07 Jan/12:06] <CJ^> yeap

[07 Jan/12:17] <DaDsMoOtH> it'll say SB or creative in it, right?
[07 Jan/12:17] <CJ^> just renamed the files to autoexec.old  and config.old
[07 Jan/12:17] <CJ^> right
[07 Jan/12:17] <CJ^> exactly...
[07 Jan/12:18] <CJ^> anythign that says that

[07 Jan/12:19] <CJ^> cause  win98 doesnt need them really..
[07 Jan/12:19] <CJ^> thats why i just renamed the files..
[07 Jan/12:19] <CJ^> or..  like i had sa8id  just re-installed the drivers and DID not load the DOS drivers...

[07 Jan/12:22] <devilDigg> w98 whois CJ^
[07 Jan/12:22] <DaDsMoOtH> Aren't those things there for a reason though?  Why even have them in the first place if you're better off with out them?
[07 Jan/12:22] <CJ^> DOS/Legacy support
[07 Jan/12:23] <CJ^> thats why
[07 Jan/12:23] <CJ^> you dont really need em
[07 Jan/12:23] <CJ^> unless you play DOS games
[07 Jan/12:23] <CJ^> but  if ya do.....
[07 Jan/12:23] <CJ^> its best to make seperate instances for em...
[07 Jan/12:23] <CJ^> legacy support is all but gone from teh industry anyways
[07 Jan/12:24] <devilDigg> he's only 48 secs away, he should have responded by now..
[07 Jan/12:25] <DaDsMoOtH> So...i can leave it like it is now.  But...if w98 keeps crashing, i should probably just uncheck everything on those 2 tabs?

[07 Jan/14:20] <CJ^> you actually bought that thing??
[07 Jan/14:20] <jncoboy> is there a way to make a modem drop a connection when i receive a call?
[07 Jan/14:20] <mrgone> i have one in my kitchen
[07 Jan/14:20] <j3ss1> my job deals with ifomercials
[07 Jan/14:20] <j3ss1> I rank them
[07 Jan/14:20] <Big`Ed> jncoboy - how can you recieve a call - if your on-line?
[07 Jan/14:20] <mrgone> got the biggest one they sell
[07 Jan/14:20] <Big`Ed> that would be a phone company option
[07 Jan/14:20] <jncoboy> i mean..
[07 Jan/14:20] <mrgone> cj it rules
[07 Jan/14:20] <jncoboy> if i get a call the modem disconnects
[07 Jan/14:20] <Big`Ed> jncoboy - how would you know you get a call?  call waiting?
[07 Jan/14:20] <LosGuy> jncoboy you cant, not with a normal phone line anyway
[07 Jan/14:22] <jncoboy> o
[07 Jan/14:22] <LosGuy> if you have call waiting that is disconnecting you... you can disable that
[07 Jan/14:22] <Big`Ed> call waiting will 'drop a modem'
[07 Jan/14:22] <jncoboy> wonder how much call waiting is
[07 Jan/14:22] <mrgone> i got call waiting, was 1$ a mnth extra plus i get unlimited 3 way calls
[07 Jan/14:22] <mrgone> i got call id too, so i can tell when ed pranks me at 3am thank you muchly ed
[07 Jan/14:22] <pyrokiwi> lol
[07 Jan/14:22] <LosGuy> haha

[07 Jan/14:47] <DancingBe> I have a simple question can someone help me?
[07 Jan/14:47] <LosGuy> dunno till we hear it
[07 Jan/14:48] <Azmodan> we can only try
[07 Jan/14:48] <CountMech> only try
[07 Jan/14:48] <DancingBe> from my understanding: win2k (I'm currently using win98) has 3 versions (primary versions): professional, server, and advanced server right?
[07 Jan/14:49] <CJ^> 4 versions
[07 Jan/14:49] <CJ^> Data Center being the Last
[07 Jan/14:49] <DancingBe> what am I missing?
[07 Jan/14:49] ! LordAdolf is known as hickychic
[07 Jan/14:49] <CJ^> Data Center may actually ship later
[07 Jan/14:49] <DancingBe> cj, I also hear something obscure called "corporate version" is that the same as dataccenter version?
[07 Jan/14:50] <CJ^> might be
[07 Jan/14:50] <CJ^> Data Center is the actual Replacement for E-Prise
[07 Jan/14:50] <DancingBe> so, what's so special about the dcenter version u talked about?
[07 Jan/14:50] <Azmodan> unless you mean corporate preview version
[07 Jan/14:50] <DancingBe> ahh I see, maybe Azmo
[07 Jan/14:50] <CJ^> might just be
[07 Jan/14:50] <CJ^> DTC is E-Prise to extreme
[07 Jan/14:51] <CJ^> 36+ proc support
[07 Jan/14:51] <CJ^> 4gig + memory support..
[07 Jan/14:51] <CJ^> mostly for very large systems...
[07 Jan/14:51] <DancingBe> Highest version (with most features for a 56k person) appropriate for avg joe schmo is server version right?
[07 Jan/14:51] <CJ^> Like high end alphas
[07 Jan/14:51] <CJ^> well Dancing  are you a Win NT user?

[07 Jan/14:57] <nsonx> lag
[07 Jan/14:57] <CJ^> nsonx... well.. cause no sense in having winroute a system when its primary purpose is to share connections...
[07 Jan/14:57] <Azmodan> nsonx, becuase its a piece of professional router software
[07 Jan/14:57] <CJ^> why only have 1 user?

[07 Jan/19:48] <Spoodge> is it possible for me to dl a new driver and just install it
[07 Jan/19:49] <musical5> I bought the ata/66 controller due to the problems I was having
[07 Jan/19:49] <Los`Guy> oh... your ATA/66 ... 
[07 Jan/19:49] <cwoods> Spoodge, if the video card mfg has a web site, you should be able to.
[07 Jan/19:49] <musical5> thought it was maybe the onboard controller that went bad
[07 Jan/19:49] <Los`Guy> musical5 looked for a bios upgrade even?
[07 Jan/19:49] <Los`Guy> I would bet it is related to that

[07 Jan/21:15] <DaDsMoOtH> ?
[07 Jan/21:15] <CJ^> depends ont eh system

[07 Jan/21:16] <CJ^> heh
[07 Jan/21:16] <Los`Guy> in bios.. you will see the option
[07 Jan/21:16] <CJ^> Dads  it depends ont eh BIOS...
[07 Jan/21:17] <CJ^> not all allow it to stop boot up
[07 Jan/21:17] <CJ^> you would have to read the system manula
[07 Jan/21:17] <CJ^> or mb manual
[07 Jan/21:18] <DaDsMoOtH> I have an ASUS P3B-F motherboard
[07 Jan/21:18] <CJ^> then check the mb manual..
[07 Jan/21:18] <CJ^> see if the BIOS password can be set to STOP bootup
[07 Jan/21:18] <CJ^> some can.....
[07 Jan/21:20] <DaDsMoOtH> You know what i mean right.  For instance...i want to hit the reset button.  While it starts booting, i want "Enter password: " to come up.  As soon as i enter the password, i want the computer to finish booting and then load windows.
[07 Jan/21:20] <DaDsMoOtH> are we on the same page here?
[07 Jan/21:21] <CJ^> yes
[07 Jan/21:21] <CJ^> BUT
[07 Jan/21:21] <CJ^> again
[07 Jan/21:21] <CJ^> not all BIOS's have th feature that stops boot up with a password..
[07 Jan/21:21] <CJ^> ONLY some
[07 Jan/21:21] <CJ^> actually all have the feature..
[07 Jan/21:21] <CJ^> not all are enabled..
[07 Jan/21:22] <CJ^> meaning that a BIOS is capable of doign this...
[07 Jan/21:22] <CJ^> not all MB makers put it in
[07 Jan/21:25] <DaDsMoOtH> hmmmmmmmmmm
[07 Jan/21:25] <DaDsMoOtH> i've now read the stuff
[07 Jan/21:26] <DaDsMoOtH> it has a supervisor and user password option
[07 Jan/21:26] <DaDsMoOtH> the supervisor option (when enabled) restricts access to the bios and those settings
[07 Jan/21:26] <DaDsMoOtH> the user option i'm puzzled on.
[07 Jan/21:26] <DaDsMoOtH> it mentions it
[07 Jan/21:26] <DaDsMoOtH> but doesn't mention what it does
[07 Jan/21:27] <DaDsMoOtH> i'm thinking that it's the option to stop boot up...would you agree?

[07 Jan/21:58] <CJ^> do ya mean its just slower???
[07 Jan/21:59] <^russia> no cj..not slower...nothing on the screen at all
[07 Jan/21:59] <CJ^> well..
[07 Jan/21:59] <CJ^> replace the edo with the SDRAM
[07 Jan/21:59] <LosGuy> in other words your computer isnt working...is the memory setup right in bios?]
[07 Jan/21:59] <CJ^> its nto a win98 issue
[07 Jan/21:59] <CJ^> it a hardware issue...
[07 Jan/22:00] <CJ^> or does it even boot up?
[07 Jan/22:00] <LosGuy> or on your MB for that matter if it is an option
[07 Jan/22:00] <^russia> maybe the bios yes..but I cant see the screen to alter the bios
[07 Jan/22:00] <CJ^> then the ram may be bad..
[07 Jan/22:00] <LosGuy> is the memory seated properly?
[07 Jan/22:00] <CJ^> OR you didnt set up the ram for the MB correctly...
[07 Jan/22:01] <CJ^> or that too...
[07 Jan/22:01] <LosGuy> does the computer boot? (or appear to from hard drive activity?)
[07 Jan/22:01] <LosGuy> or beep unusually?
[07 Jan/22:01] <^russia> there are 4..72 pin edo slots..i populated all slots with 16MB simms
[07 Jan/22:02] <LosGuy> does your motherboard support that configuration of memory?
[07 Jan/22:02] <CJ^> are they matched sets of EDO?

[07 Jan/22:05] <CJ^> yes russia...
[07 Jan/22:05] <CJ^> its nto booting
[07 Jan/22:05] <CJ^> pull the ram
[07 Jan/22:05] <LosGuy> pull 2 of them anyway
[07 Jan/22:05] <CJ^> and replace it with the SDRAM that was there..
[07 Jan/22:06] <^russia> ok cj thanks....could it also be rectified in the bios
[07 Jan/22:06] <LosGuy> not if you cant see the bios :)
[07 Jan/22:06] <^russia> in other words does the bios have to be altered to cope with edo ram
[07 Jan/22:07] <CJ^> russia.. maybe

[07 Jan/22:08] <CJ^> hmmm
[07 Jan/22:08] <^russia> if i replace the sdram as you suggested...and can then see the screen..can i then alter the bios to accommodate the edo ram
[07 Jan/22:08] <LosGuy> russia  try pulling two of them first
[07 Jan/22:08] <CJ^> russia  IF the bios has to alterted yes
[07 Jan/22:08] <LosGuy> and see if it will boot

[07 Jan/22:11] <LosGuy> if you are doing something that your mb wont support ....well 
[07 Jan/22:11] <CJ^> the problem IS the memory
[07 Jan/22:11] <CJ^> try pulling two sticks like Los said..
[07 Jan/22:11] <^russia> ok   thanks...you must be reading a different manual to one I've ever seen  :-))))))
[07 Jan/22:11] <CJ^> it may be that you didnt set the jumpers correctly...
[07 Jan/22:11] <CJ^> ir maybe that the ram is bad

[07 Jan/22:11] <LosGuy> russia they are all different

[08 Jan/10:16] <ohiogirl> i have a question. i have a friend that signed up with compuserve, i am trying to set up her email on netscape. where you usually enter something like "mail.cs.com" doesn't work for compuserve. can't get through to them. does anyone know what needs to go there. please. :)

[08 Jan/10:17] <Azmodan> ohiogirl, I do not know.  But you may find the information you require on compuserves web site
[08 Jan/10:17] <Azmodan> chph, if its a 64k isdn then 100bytes/second would be atrocious
[08 Jan/10:17] <chph> huh?
[08 Jan/10:18] <Azmodan> chph, that is what your complaining about right?  Lack of speed
[08 Jan/10:18] <chph> yeps
[08 Jan/10:18] <ohiogirl> i tried that. and I have called them and can never get through. she got this as part of a rebate with the purchase of a computer. it came with NO information at all
[08 Jan/10:18] <Azmodan> chph, then the first people to talk to would be the ISDN providers.  I cannot help you with ISDN as I have not used it personally.

[08 Jan/16:33] <Quiver> right..
[08 Jan/16:33] <Azmodan> delete all of them except the one for dial up networking (RNA.PWL I believe)
[08 Jan/16:34] <Azmodan> then restart your computer
[08 Jan/16:34] <Azmodan> when it asks for login and password just give it a login name
[08 Jan/16:34] <Azmodan> no password
[08 Jan/16:34] <Azmodan> it will ask you to verify just click ok
[08 Jan/16:34] <Azmodan> that should stop it

[08 Jan/16:49] <Goth25> The API structures of windows are very poor - they just throw stuff together.  Why should a user application be allowed to directly change hardware modes?  Isn't that what DirectX is for?  Why doesn't DirectX obey monitor settings?

[08 Jan/16:49] <Azmodan> Goth25, that still doesn't explain you equating VESA with windows
[08 Jan/16:50] <Goth25> By providing a consistant API and usage guidelines and not allowing user programs to change modes, they could really impove things

[08 Jan/16:53] <Azmodan> Goth25, it really depends on the game, if its a game that requires directx then it will probably use directx to changes modes

[08 Jan/17:09] <Big_Dad> i removed Logic Works 4.0 
[08 Jan/17:09] <Los`Guy> hmm you could try two things that I can think of
[08 Jan/17:10] <Los`Guy> one is install tweakUI and see if you can repair it with that...or run scanreg /restore and install a previous version of the registry
[08 Jan/17:11] <Big_Dad> ok...  anything.  i had entries for like 30 other programs, and if i ever wanted to take them off i'd have to manually do it leaving unused dlls on my drive and unneccisarty registry keys
[08 Jan/17:11] <Los`Guy> assuming that info is in the registry
[08 Jan/17:11] <Los`Guy> Big_Dad maybe not... lots of programs have an uninstaller in the folder you installed them to
[08 Jan/17:11] <Los`Guy> ie the ones that say unwise.exe
[08 Jan/17:12] <Big_Dad> yeah but not all of them...  I am pretty sure there is a designated file that stores all of the information for Add/Remove though.
[08 Jan/17:13] <walkndude> scanreg /restore  will be the best bet IMO

[08 Jan/17:46] <bonqer> hey whats up
[08 Jan/17:47] <Big_Dad> i partitioned my primary drive to hold linux, NT, and 98 partitions.  any idea why it insists on a 7 meg partition at the end of the drive?  no matter how i resize, it has to hold that 7 megs at the end in it's own extended partition.
[08 Jan/17:47] <`Muff`> Drive letters are assigned by primary DOS (1 per drive) then extended (logical) drives per drive...
[08 Jan/17:47] ! ChiwiOut is known as FLC
[08 Jan/17:47] <`Muff`> Dad, pick one and go to that help group ;)
[08 Jan/17:48] <Big_Dad> ahhh ok, it's not that big of a prob.  i just store my source code on that drive anyway.
[08 Jan/17:49] <`Muff`> It may be a BIOS limitation as well, Dad...
[08 Jan/17:49] <Big_Dad> maybe, I know there is an upgrade for my BIOS out there speaking of, I should look for it.
[08 Jan/17:50] <`Muff`> Are you using EZ Drive or Disk Manager or something to set it up, Dad?
[08 Jan/17:50] <lldfodd> Thank you very much pals, Thanks Muff!!! Its a good idea and I will try it :)
[08 Jan/17:51] <`Muff`> :)  np fodd 
[08 Jan/17:51] <Big_Dad> `Muff`: I use Partition Magic for my partitions.
[08 Jan/17:51] <`Muff`> I use presize... freeware ;)
[08 Jan/17:51] <lldfodd> Can I make only an extended partition with F-Disk?
[08 Jan/17:51] <`Muff`> Yup, fodd
[08 Jan/17:51] <Big_Dad> Can you repartition with FDISK if you have existing data on your drive?
[08 Jan/17:52] <lldfodd> I also have Partition Magic :) Okay :))) I will give it a try verrrrry soon LOL
[08 Jan/17:52] <`Muff`> No, Dad.  Fdisk wipes everything out

[08 Jan/21:37] <Cue_Ball> hmm
[08 Jan/21:38] <LosGuy> but the jumpers need to be set properly and assuming you plugged them in correctly 
[08 Jan/21:38] <LosGuy> it shouild be working

[09 Jan/00:08] <|Dv8|> anyone here?
[09 Jan/00:09] <|Greeny|> i'm so desperate
[09 Jan/00:09] <|Greeny|> plz...
[09 Jan/00:09] <|Dv8|> what's wrong ?
[09 Jan/00:09] <|Greeny|> i think i had a virus, dunno, i did something and my com CRASHED and i had to format it
[09 Jan/00:09] <|Greeny|> so i started all from the beggining
[09 Jan/00:09] <|Greeny|> but my modem - 56K
[09 Jan/00:10] <|Greeny|> now running 33.600
[09 Jan/00:10] <|Greeny|> and i can't log to the internet
[09 Jan/00:10] <|Greeny|> when i install a prog it does the memory low (RAM mabe?)
[09 Jan/00:10] <|Greeny|> and i don't know what to do!!!
[09 Jan/00:10] <|Dv8|> reinstall the drivers for the modem
[09 Jan/00:10] <|Dv8|> it's not the ram
[09 Jan/00:11] <|Greeny|> i did dat already
[09 Jan/00:11] <LosGuy> conflicts?
[09 Jan/00:11] <|Greeny|> ?
[09 Jan/00:11] <|Dv8|> and don't worry about what it is telling you for the speed..that is not always right...I am running at 115,200 bps...not really but that's what it says
[09 Jan/00:12] <|Dv8|> right click my computer and them click properties
[09 Jan/00:12] <LosGuy> and how much ram does it say you have when your Right click on contol panel and choose properties?
[09 Jan/00:12] <|Greeny|> i dunno, ARG, my hole system is fucked i think

[09 Jan/00:13] <|Greeny|> sorry hehehe
[09 Jan/00:13] <LosGuy> any conficts there ?
[09 Jan/00:13] <|Greeny|> oh
[09 Jan/00:13] <|Greeny|> lemme check
[09 Jan/00:14] <|Greeny|> nopies
[09 Jan/00:14] <|Dv8|> LosGuy..I may have been wrong on what I thought was wrong....could a loose wire from the power supply cause it to freeze without actually cutting all power?
[09 Jan/00:14] <LosGuy> re your modem install the drivers that came with your modem
[09 Jan/00:14] <LosGuy> instead of the default win98 drivers
[09 Jan/00:14] <|Greeny|> i know
[09 Jan/00:14] <LosGuy> uh |Dv8| I guess
[09 Jan/00:15] <|Greeny|> you think i should reinstall win98?
[09 Jan/00:15] <LosGuy> that woudl be kinda odd
[09 Jan/00:15] <|Greeny|> hmmm
[09 Jan/00:15] <|Dv8|> what woudl be odd?
[09 Jan/00:15] <LosGuy> I thought you said you just did?
[09 Jan/00:15] <LosGuy> the loose wire 
[09 Jan/00:15] <|Greeny|> i had to install win98 ALL OVER AGAIN cause my hole damn computer got formatted
[09 Jan/00:16] <LosGuy> are you running antivirus?
[09 Jan/00:16] <LosGuy> are you sure it is gone?
[09 Jan/00:16] <|Greeny|> when you install a prog, it has 3 meters, 1 - file installation, 2 - hole installation, 3 - MEMORY
[09 Jan/00:16] <|Greeny|> right?
[09 Jan/00:16] <LosGuy> a virus can bring a system to its knees performancewise
[09 Jan/00:17] <|Greeny|> can a virus still stay after formatting the hole hole hole computer?
[09 Jan/00:17] <LosGuy> yes
[09 Jan/00:17] <|Greeny|> oh
[09 Jan/00:17] <|Dv8|> oh..well I found a loose wire in there and I was even told about the previous owner jiggling wires to get it to work...there are about 20 wires so I figured not all of them are power wires and it may cause it to freeze
[09 Jan/00:17] <|Greeny|> so what should i do?
[09 Jan/00:17] <LosGuy> it depends on the type of virus
[09 Jan/00:17] <LosGuy> go to avp.com
[09 Jan/00:17] <LosGuy> and dl a scanner

[09 Jan/03:06] <CJ^> the start menu?
[09 Jan/03:06] <DavyJones> yes
[09 Jan/03:07] <DavyJones> If I choose start/programs the menu of apps is not sorted also any time I install a new application it is put at the bottom of the list and does not re-sort itself. And... It is long It does not show mulitiple columns I have to choose to scroll down or up to see the entire list
[09 Jan/03:08] <CJ^> thats normal
[09 Jan/03:08] <DavyJones> the long list or the non-sorting?

[09 Jan/03:46] <CJ^> remoux  the one computer that you see all those computers on.. it logs on to a doamin?
[09 Jan/03:46] <CJ^> er domain...
[09 Jan/03:47] <remoux> iknow but how can i share it all on my computer two
[09 Jan/03:47] <CJ^> what are you using to share the internet connection?
[09 Jan/03:47] <remoux> windows 
[09 Jan/03:48] <remoux> default
[09 Jan/03:48] <remoux> program
[09 Jan/03:48] <CJ^> ICS?
[09 Jan/03:48] <remoux> yes
[09 Jan/03:48] <remoux> with two lan cards
[09 Jan/03:49] <CJ^> if you are sharing the main computers connectionto the net  you wont see those computers on the second computer...
[09 Jan/03:49] <CJ^> if the BOTH computers are given the same access tot he cable modem you will..
[09 Jan/03:49] <CJ^> its normal...
[09 Jan/03:49] <CJ^> one is logged on to the domain..
[09 Jan/03:49] <CJ^> the other is just sharing the connection
[09 Jan/03:51] <remoux> how can i do that
[09 Jan/03:51] <remoux> with windows server
[09 Jan/03:51] <remoux> net
[09 Jan/03:51] <remoux> nt
[09 Jan/03:51] <CJ^> no...
[09 Jan/03:51] <CJ^> the other computer would have to be assigned an IP from your ISP
[09 Jan/03:51] <CJ^> OR...
[09 Jan/03:52] <CJ^> you may be able to do it with a hub...
[09 Jan/03:52] <remoux> or
[09 Jan/03:52] <CJ^> but  i dont think your ISp will allow this...
[09 Jan/03:52] <CJ^> both computers have to be allowed access to the network..
[09 Jan/03:52] <remoux> impossible to do that by a prog
[09 Jan/03:52] <CJ^> right
[09 Jan/03:52] <remoux> i can i know that ????
[09 Jan/03:52] <remoux> phone them ???
[09 Jan/03:52] <CJ^> your ISP has to allow the other computer access tot he network..

[09 Jan/03:54] <Archker> Can anyone help me with a graphic card problem?
[09 Jan/03:54] <ThAmsTeR> depends
[09 Jan/03:55] <ThAmsTeR> what's the prob?
[09 Jan/03:55] <Archker> I have a AGP card, and then I install it and restart the computer. But then when windows opens it hangs and I get an orange screen with stripes all over... why?
[09 Jan/03:55] <CJ^> arch  depends onteh AGP card  and the AGP chipset
[09 Jan/03:55] <Archker> it's an Intel740
[09 Jan/03:56] <CJ^> ok... and what AGP chipset do you have?  and are you using the correct drivers for both the chipset and the card?
[09 Jan/03:56] <remoux> cj whit wingate it wont work
[09 Jan/03:56] <CJ^> remoux  you can try
[09 Jan/03:56] <Archker> I think I have the right drivers... they're the ones that came with the card
[09 Jan/03:57] <CJ^> www.cablemodemhelp.com has all the answere you need really..
[09 Jan/03:57] <remoux> oki thanks !!!
[09 Jan/03:57] <CJ^> arch  ok  but soem AGP chipsets have issues with some AGP cards..
[09 Jan/03:57] <CJ^> ALi5 chipsets for example...
[09 Jan/03:57] <CJ^> ThAmster  telnet server.. hmm
[09 Jan/03:57] <CJ^> looking that one up..  what are ya trying to do really?
[09 Jan/03:57] <Archker> but it works fine without the drivers... just slight too few colors...
[09 Jan/03:58] <CJ^> um  then you dont have drivers installed...
[09 Jan/03:59] <CJ^> if your not getting 16color-32bit  you dont have drivers installed..
[09 Jan/03:59] <Archker> mm
[09 Jan/03:59] <Archker> I know that...
[09 Jan/03:59] <Archker> but when I install the drivers, I can't start win98
[09 Jan/04:00] <CJ^> again...  what mb chipset do you have?
[09 Jan/04:00] < ThAmsTeR!thamster@ti19a06-0004.dialup.online.no has left #win98 ()
[09 Jan/04:00] <CJ^> ok.. what model or make of i740?  card brand name...
[09 Jan/04:00] <Archker> it's Daytona...
[09 Jan/04:00] <Archker> 8mb
[09 Jan/04:01] <CJ^> ok...
[09 Jan/04:01] <CJ^> and what motherboard chipset?
[09 Jan/04:01] <CJ^> intel? sis? VIA? ALi5?
[09 Jan/04:01] <Archker> intel, I guess
[09 Jan/04:01] <Archker> I don't know!
[09 Jan/04:01] <Archker> but it's an ASUS board
[09 Jan/04:01] <CJ^> asus P5a?
[09 Jan/04:02] <CJ^> AMD k6?
[09 Jan/04:02] ! mountain is known as dess
[09 Jan/04:02] <Archker> amd k7
[09 Jan/04:02] ! dess is known as mountain
[09 Jan/04:02] <CJ^> ahhh
[09 Jan/04:02] <CJ^> see...
[09 Jan/04:03] <Archker> Intel hates AMD, yes, but it should work anyway.... no?
[09 Jan/04:04] <CJ^> it has littel to do with that
[09 Jan/04:04] <Archker> then what is it?
[09 Jan/04:05] <CJ^> some AGP cards have trouble with SOME agp chipsets..
[09 Jan/04:05] <CJ^> thast what im looking up...
[09 Jan/04:05] <Archker> oh
[09 Jan/04:07] <CJ^> ok.. being that Asus doesnt even list the Km7...  check the MB manual for the chipset...
[09 Jan/04:08] <Archker> ok...
[09 Jan/04:08] <Archker> well, they have a site with it!
[09 Jan/04:08] <Archker> you just have to search altavista to get to it...
[09 Jan/04:08] <CJ^> heh
[09 Jan/04:08] <CJ^> yeah  but they went cloak and dagger to avoid Intel...
[09 Jan/04:08] <CJ^> :P
[09 Jan/04:08] <Archker> :)
[09 Jan/04:08] <remoux> cj another question 
[09 Jan/04:09] <remoux> how come my computer blocks when it doesn't do anything
[09 Jan/04:09] <remoux> like when i'm not home for 3 hours when i come back the computer is blocked

[09 Jan/04:11] <remoux> no screensaver
[09 Jan/04:11] <remoux> just the desktop
[09 Jan/04:11] <CJ^> you mean it locks up?
[09 Jan/04:12] <Archker> well, maybe the computer went mad since you weren't using it....

[09 Jan/04:22] <CJ^> it could be any number of things...
[09 Jan/04:22] <CJ^> the best place to start is for YOU to go look at all teh latest drivers.

[09 Jan/05:24] <Raph2000> anybody know something about Win98 here ?
[09 Jan/05:24] <Big_Dad> what something?  depends.
[09 Jan/05:24] <Raph2000> a weird error message when I execute a program
[09 Jan/05:25] <Raph2000> the program is an Encoder MPEG
[09 Jan/05:25] <Raph2000> it was working great.
[09 Jan/05:25] <Raph2000> and now for no reason it gave me this error message when I try to encode something.
[09 Jan/05:25] <Big_Dad> why do you think it is a Windows98 error?
[09 Jan/05:25] <Raph2000> I think it calls a WIndows Routine...but I can't find it a replace it.
[09 Jan/05:25] <Raph2000> here is the error message.
[09 Jan/05:26] <Raph2000> "Microsoft Visual C++ runtime library error'

[09 Jan/05:27] <Kraftwerk> how can i lock directory with pass?
[09 Jan/05:27] <Raph2000> I've checked technet..but found nothing, any idea ?
[09 Jan/05:27] <Big_Dad> Raph2000: I don't think it's a Win98 error, looks like a corrupt DLL or something.
[09 Jan/05:28] <Raph2000> you think ? but it doesn't gave me a DLL file to check.*
[09 Jan/05:28] <Big_Dad> runtime libraries are DLLs
[09 Jan/05:28] <Raph2000> ok.
[09 Jan/05:29] <Raph2000> any idea how can I check which one my program use ?
[09 Jan/05:29] <Big_Dad> file2mon
[09 Jan/05:29] <Big_Dad> it's a freeware application that monitors all files
[09 Jan/05:29] <Raph2000> ok i'll check that ..Thanks.
[09 Jan/05:29] <Big_Dad> like reg2mon if you know anything about that, it monitors all access to the registry
[09 Jan/05:29] <Big_Dad> sure
[09 Jan/05:33] <Kraftwerk> how can i lock directory with password?
[09 Jan/05:34] <Big_Dad> Kraftwerk: I've never seen that done except for on networks.
[09 Jan/05:34] <Kraftwerk> tnx
[09 Jan/05:34] <Kraftwerk> i want to that wit my min98
[09 Jan/05:34] <Kraftwerk> on nt its easy/////
[09 Jan/05:35] <Big_Dad> yeah I don't think you can password protect folders in 98
[09 Jan/05:36] <Kraftwerk> i also didnt find how to remove document folder on start meny...
[09 Jan/05:36] <Raph2000> use WinZip with Password maybe
[09 Jan/05:36] <Kraftwerk> or to disable his function
[09 Jan/05:36] <Kraftwerk> jes.....
[09 Jan/05:36] <Big_Dad> you can clear the items in the document folder
[09 Jan/05:37] <Kraftwerk> but its a very big folder
[09 Jan/05:37] <Kraftwerk> i dont want to clear them
[09 Jan/05:37] <Kraftwerk> i wont to be auto cleared allwaya:)

[09 Jan/06:53] <IronFist> When I go to the start menu, and then go up to documents, it lists a bunch of files, how do I remove those, without dragging them to the trash one by one, can I remove them permanently? so there will be no documents folder there completely?

[09 Jan/08:04] <Buddy123> NCR 53c80-40 is the chipset

[09 Jan/08:33] @ mode #win98 [+v NoNameGS] by Vulcan!itsnotme@the.best.os.is.linux.am
[09 Jan/08:33] <CJ^> Microsoft Windows Media Player upgrades the previous versions of Media Player, NetShow player, and ActiveMovie player and plays most multimedia content formats located on the Internet or your computer, including Windows Media, Real Audio/
[09 Jan/08:34] <CJ^> Media player replaces all those...
[09 Jan/08:34] <CJ^> if you have Media Player 6 or better  ya dont need Netshow...
[09 Jan/08:34] <CJ^> thats from MS's site
[09 Jan/08:35] <CJ^> yes
[09 Jan/08:35] <CJ^> mbr...  what is so speacial about Netshow?
[09 Jan/08:35] <CJ^> the Media Plaer is supposed to replace it anyways...
[09 Jan/08:35] <CJ^> so  if ya have that  you are ok...
[09 Jan/08:35] <CJ^> according to MS's site...
[09 Jan/08:35] <|mbr|> cj: i understand that but ms screwed up and put the full version of the fraunhofer codec in the netshow that comes with 98
[09 Jan/08:36] <|mbr|> the full version codec
[09 Jan/08:36] <NoNameGS> when explorer had caused an error, you know when you close it, it restarts but tray icons are gone. so how can I run tray icons when they are not in system tray?
[09 Jan/08:36] <|mbr|> they mistakingly placed the full version instead of the reduced one into the netshow on the cd
[09 Jan/08:37] <CJ^> NoName  thats case explorer crashed..
[09 Jan/08:37] <CJ^> reboot...
[09 Jan/08:37] <|mbr|> or log off
[09 Jan/08:37] <NoNameGS> any other way?
[09 Jan/08:37] <CJ^> but also run SFC after rebot to see if anythign is corrputed..
[09 Jan/08:37] <|mbr|> that will reload your start up files
[09 Jan/08:38] <CJ^> http://www.annoyances.org/win98/  try there
[09 Jan/08:38] <NoNameGS> cant I access to running system tray icons? 
[09 Jan/08:38] <|mbr|> YES!
[09 Jan/08:38] <|mbr|> i just uninstalled media player and now i can see netshow

[09 Jan/11:48] <tooner> yep
[09 Jan/11:48] <LosGuy> ok
[09 Jan/11:48] <LosGuy> and the win98se machine is the machine with the modem right?
[09 Jan/11:48] <tooner> yep
[09 Jan/11:48] <LosGuy> ok
[09 Jan/11:48] <LosGuy> do this
[09 Jan/11:49] <LosGuy> UNinstall ICS
[09 Jan/11:49] <LosGuy> then reinstall it
[09 Jan/11:49] <LosGuy> it doesnt work if you install during win98 install
[09 Jan/11:49] <tooner> cool
[09 Jan/11:49] <tooner> ill try that now
[09 Jan/11:49] <LosGuy> you should also
[09 Jan/11:50] <LosGuy> set a static IP on the host machine
[09 Jan/11:50] <LosGuy> and a dynamic IP on the client
[09 Jan/11:50] <RaZl3> DaZ
[09 Jan/11:50] <LosGuy> and the other machine (the client) should not have dialup networking installed
[09 Jan/11:52] <tooner> dynamic ip?
[09 Jan/11:52] <tooner> do you need too?
[09 Jan/11:52] <LosGuy> it can be done static...but you may have problems... if you use dynamic on the client you will allmost certainly have success right away

[09 Jan/12:01] <VerLudwig> someone gave me a PB machine, pent 200. I was wondering if I could use my install cd from my hewlitt packard puter to put w98 on the pb
[09 Jan/12:02] <LosGuy> not legally I belive and probably not easily
[09 Jan/12:02] <VerLudwig> it has alot of propriatory crap on it
[09 Jan/12:03] <LosGuy> yeah 
[09 Jan/12:03] <LosGuy> so do the PB oem versions

[09 Jan/12:05] <VerLudwig> but it has an intell pent 200 in it

[09 Jan/13:53] <d00k> can someone give me some assistance then
[09 Jan/13:53] <Big`Ed> sprout - how about your directx - did you upgrade that?
[09 Jan/13:53] <CJ^> in the performance tab  does it say that there is a DOS mode ?
[09 Jan/13:53] <CJ^> if nto
[09 Jan/13:53] <CJ^> chekc the msconfig again
[09 Jan/13:53] <sprout> big`ed: @ dx7
[09 Jan/13:53] <Badsnot> I have the upgrade ver of Win98, and am currently running Win95b.  I'd like to low-level the HD and install fresh.  Does anyone know if I could simply use a win95 boot disk to boot my system after deleting everything, and then run the win98 setup from dos?
[09 Jan/13:54] <LosGuy> what is the problem with part magic d00k?
[09 Jan/13:54] <Big`Ed> sprout - was all your updates from the windows update site?
[09 Jan/13:54] <CJ^> Badsnot  if you have cdrom drivers  yes...
[09 Jan/13:54] <sprout> big`ed: yes
[09 Jan/13:54] <Jonis> in autoexec.bat?
[09 Jan/13:54] <d00k> loseguy: i have a 8gig drive d, and it is only letting me set it for 2gigs
[09 Jan/13:54] <CJ^> yes jonis...
[09 Jan/13:54] <LosGuy> Badsnot better yet use your win95 machine to make a boot disk
[09 Jan/13:54] <CJ^> and config.sys
[09 Jan/13:54] <Big`Ed> Badsnot - do you still have the win95b CD?
[09 Jan/13:55] <LosGuy> read fat32ebd.txt on your win98 cdrom Badsnot
[09 Jan/13:55] <Badsnot> I do...cool thanks...wanted to find out before I painted myself into a corner..and yes I still have the win95 cd
[09 Jan/13:55] <CJ^> then yer good to go badsnot
[09 Jan/13:55] <Badsnot> gotcha
[09 Jan/13:55] <LosGuy> d00k is the drive fat 32 or fat16?
[09 Jan/13:55] <Jonis> autoexect:path=c:\;c:\windows;c:\windows\command;c:\windows\command\edb;c:\dos
[09 Jan/13:55] <Big`Ed> Badsnot - if you have win98 upgrade, and original cd
[09 Jan/13:55] <CJ^> jonis..
[09 Jan/13:55] <Big`Ed> Badsnot - you can use win98 boot disk and do everything
[09 Jan/13:55] <d00k> LosGuy: fat32
[09 Jan/13:55] <CJ^> then you didnt renam the files...
[09 Jan/13:55] <CJ^> if you see anythign in there  ya didnt rename the files...
[09 Jan/13:55] <Badsnot> yes, original...as much as I hated paying the 89 bucks:)

[09 Jan/13:55] <Jonis> nothing
[09 Jan/13:56] <d00k> LosGuy: maybe 2 years
[09 Jan/13:56] <Big`Ed> Badsnot - if you can boot with the windows98 startup diskette - and see your cd-rom - your all set
[09 Jan/13:56] <marsby> hey anyone have any ideas of what causes 0e type fatal errors?
[09 Jan/13:56] <LosGuy> hmm you might need to go look for a bios upgrade that has large hard drive support (that new should have it though)
[09 Jan/13:56] <Badsnot> How can I go about making a win98 boot disk without having win98 installed?
[09 Jan/13:56] <Big`Ed> sprout - i'm out of ideas - it does not sound like a windows problem
[09 Jan/13:56] <VerLudwig> CJ^: talked to a kid at best buy and he thought if I upgraded the bios that it should work fine
[09 Jan/13:56] <sprout> crappo
[09 Jan/13:57] <d00k> LosGuy: i believe it has that .. prompts that when i go into fdisk
[09 Jan/13:57] <CJ^> Verl  good luck fiding the bios upgrade...
[09 Jan/13:57] <LosGuy> Badsnot I already told you read fat32ebd.txt on your win98 cdrom
[09 Jan/13:57] <CJ^> try NEC's site
[09 Jan/13:57] <Badsnot> ahhh
[09 Jan/13:57] <VerLudwig> wouldn't be on the pb site?
[09 Jan/13:57] <LosGuy> yes did you choose it dook?
[09 Jan/13:57] <LosGuy> and partition magic shojld be able to do that stuff though
[09 Jan/13:57] <CJ^> jonis...  now.. in the msconfig  you see nothing in the autoexec.abt and config.sys?

[09 Jan/13:59] <d00k> LosGuy: what should the partition be... (ie. logical, physical,extented, etc.
[09 Jan/14:00] <LosGuy> d00k it should be a primary partition if you want to boot win9x from it (not an extended)
[09 Jan/14:00] <d00k> LosGuy: this is for my d drive, not c
[09 Jan/14:00] <d00k> LosGuy: so i'm not booting from it
[09 Jan/14:00] <Big`Ed> why would one not boot win98 ?
[09 Jan/14:01] <LosGuy> then either primary or extended with a logical partition inside the extended will work
[09 Jan/14:01] <LosGuy> Ed? boot from a logical partition?
[09 Jan/14:01] <Azmodan> a logical partition cannot be set startable
[09 Jan/14:02] <Big`Ed> win98 only installs by default to C: on the primary partition

[09 Jan/15:32] <phibman> that one?
[09 Jan/15:32] <CJ^> then later i went and did the custom install of the drivers and did nto install DOS drivers
[09 Jan/15:33] <CJ^> right
[09 Jan/15:33] <phibman> should i leave the set blaster line??
[09 Jan/15:33] <CJ^> no
[09 Jan/15:33] <CJ^> all of it gone
[09 Jan/15:33] <CJ^> there are three ways to do this
[09 Jan/15:34] <CJ^> rename the autoexec.bat and config.sys to .old
[09 Jan/15:34] <CJ^> uncheck the lines in msconfig
[09 Jan/15:34] <CJ^> or open up sysedit
[09 Jan/15:34] <CJ^> and delete everythign in there..
[09 Jan/15:34] <CJ^> well.. 4th option
[09 Jan/15:34] <CJ^> re-install do custom and dont install DOS mode drivers

[09 Jan/16:28] <Big`Ed> hi
[09 Jan/16:28] <BLuStreek> woohooo
[09 Jan/16:28] <BLuStreek> hey can u guys help me with a dns lookup prob
[09 Jan/16:29] <BLuStreek> i got a mate on the fone and something seems to be wrong with his
[09 Jan/16:29] <Big`Ed> donno - whats the error
[09 Jan/16:29] <afex> can someone tell me why in any application a zero appears when i hit enter? (along with my cursor moving a line down like it should)
[09 Jan/16:30] <Big`Ed> afex - what program are you using to get this error?
[09 Jan/16:30] <afex> it does it in anything
[09 Jan/16:30] * LosGuy doesnt see a zero in mIRC
[09 Jan/16:30] <BLuStreek> 'cannot find server or dns error'
[09 Jan/16:30] <afex> its the weirdest thing i've ever seen
[09 Jan/16:30] <Big`Ed> in regular windows 98?
[09 Jan/16:30] <afex> yea
[09 Jan/16:30] <BLuStreek> he has got dns enabled but im thinking he needs to add the ip of the names server maybe ?
[09 Jan/16:30] <Big`Ed> on your desktop?
[09 Jan/16:31] <Big`Ed> BLuStreek - did his ISP give him DNS numbers?
[09 Jan/16:31] < SignOff: bluedog!bluedog@ip54.fort-worth10.tx.pub-ip.psi.net (Leaving)
[09 Jan/16:31] <afex> well for example....if i'm writing in notepad and hit enter at the end of a line.....a 0 will be there, along with my cursor
[09 Jan/16:31] <LosGuy> depends on his ISP BLuStreek 
[09 Jan/16:31] <Big`Ed> BLuStreek - those numbers come from the ISP
[09 Jan/16:31] <afex> as if i typed it
[09 Jan/16:31] <Big`Ed> afex - when did THIS start?
[09 Jan/16:31] <afex> almost like when you spill stuff on your keyboard and like 3 letters will be typed when you hit one
[09 Jan/16:31] <afex> like an hour ago
[09 Jan/16:32] <BLuStreek> not sure, when he joined they gave him a install cd for networking etc
[09 Jan/16:32] <Big`Ed> afex - have you rebooted?
[09 Jan/16:32] <afex> but i'm positive i didn't do anything physical to my comp
[09 Jan/16:32] <afex> yea
[09 Jan/16:32] <Big`Ed> afex - have you ran a good antivirus program?
[09 Jan/16:32] <afex> yup
[09 Jan/16:32] <Big`Ed> afex - what happens if you boot to a DOS prompt - and then type?
[09 Jan/16:32] <afex> hm
[09 Jan/16:33] <afex> i dunno
[09 Jan/16:33] <afex> ill try it
[09 Jan/16:33] <Big`Ed> you can use EDIT from \windows\command and test
[09 Jan/16:33] <afex> i should boot to the prompt, not just go to a dos prompt?
[09 Jan/16:33] <BLuStreek> ok , im telling him to re-install all his cd that he got, hopefully it will correct his problems
[09 Jan/16:34] <BLuStreek> the cd his isp gave him i meant ;]
[09 Jan/16:34] <Big`Ed> BLuStreek - ok - a bit overkill - but ok
[09 Jan/16:35] <afex> alright well ill try it and be back in a bit

[09 Jan/16:36] <BLuStreek> hmm, does it seem weird that after hes re-done the isp cd, that it didnt ask him to reboot his computer, or is that sometimes what happens ?
[09 Jan/16:36] <Big`Ed> sometimes what happens
[09 Jan/16:36] <BLuStreek> cool
[09 Jan/16:36] <CJ^> it shoudl reboot  if there are any netowrkinf changees...
[09 Jan/16:36] <CJ^> :P
[09 Jan/16:37] <BLuStreek> i told him to reboot anyways, just to be safe ;]
[09 Jan/16:38] <Big`Ed> most ISP's auto send the DNS stuff
[09 Jan/16:39] <BLuStreek> yeah thats what i thought... but hes a newbie to computers and played with somestuff i think he isnt really sure of

[09 Jan/17:16] <go> with the drivers
[09 Jan/17:16] <go> i was missing vnetsup.vxd, but got it off another puter
[09 Jan/17:16] <go> and that was it
[09 Jan/17:16] <go> now i got all this crap

[09 Jan/17:17] <go> well howcome it worked the first time?
[09 Jan/17:17] <CJ^> sometimes they do
[09 Jan/17:17] <go>  isn't there some file i can edit to fix it?
[09 Jan/17:17] <CJ^> most of the time they dont
[09 Jan/17:17] <go> so it doesn't look for the stupid MSN file?
[09 Jan/17:17] <CJ^> $1000 says yer problems with go away witha better board
[09 Jan/17:18] <CJ^> its the drivers that are causign it...
[09 Jan/17:18] <CJ^> the drives for the board..
[09 Jan/17:18] <go> yeah well if i needed a better board i wouldn't have gotten this one;-)
[09 Jan/17:18] <go> ok
[09 Jan/17:18] <CJ^> the NIC drivers are causign it to look for a lot of those...
[09 Jan/17:18] <go> ok, lets assume its the drivers
[09 Jan/17:18] <CJ^> well..  ya get what ya pay for ...

[09 Jan/17:19] <go> and which files do i edit?
[09 Jan/17:19] <go> obviously the software is prompted to look for something
[09 Jan/17:19] <CJ^> look at teh NIC drivers...

[09 Jan/17:27] <CJ^> virus?
[09 Jan/17:27] <AcesDnied> no

[09 Jan/17:27] <AcesDnied> he was going to reinstall it for some other reason, and then we started getting these probs
[09 Jan/17:28] <AcesDnied> yes, but each time it gives us the same error
[09 Jan/17:28] <Raph2000> did you format the drive before reinstalling ?
[09 Jan/17:28] <AcesDnied> just the last couple of hours

[09 Jan/19:07] <CountMech> How do I disable IE5 as my desktop?
[09 Jan/19:07] <Ptt> I burned a music cd on a CDRW cd, but it can't be play on other cd player.... it works fine before when I burned it on a CDR cd.
[09 Jan/19:08] <`Muff`> CDRW is not the media of choice for audio CDs...
[09 Jan/19:08] <^Vader^> uhh...CJ...it's a SB16...pretty standard issue...I can't quite figure out hwat could be causing it to freak while booting...it's almost as if asking a 486DX4/100 to do two things at once is a mistake...
[09 Jan/19:08] <Ptt> Muff.. know what is the problem?
[09 Jan/19:08] <LosGuy> probably cuz that cdpayer doesnt support it
[09 Jan/19:08] <mrgone> some cd players cant read cdrw's
[09 Jan/19:08] <CJ^> ok
[09 Jan/19:08] <CJ^> well your nto running dos drivers for it are you Vader??
[09 Jan/19:09] <Ptt> muff.. so I should just use a CDR cd for music cd?
[09 Jan/19:09] <mrgone> if it wont play in your cd rw its because the sound card cable is hooked to your cd rom and not your cdrw
[09 Jan/19:09] <`Muff`> Always, ptt
[09 Jan/19:09] <Ptt> muff... and use CDRW for data?
[09 Jan/19:09] <mrgone> if it wont play in your cdrom your cd rom wont read cdrw or the cable is to cdrw
[09 Jan/19:09] <mrgone> yea just use cdr for music
[09 Jan/19:10] <^Vader^> no...it was a cold install with after having been fdisked, formatted, and installed after moving all of the cab files to the HDD for installation
[09 Jan/19:10] <`Muff`> ptt, use cdrw for temp stuff and incremental backups, cdr for archives and audio CDs
[09 Jan/19:10] <Ptt> muff.. oh ok.. thanks.
[09 Jan/19:10] <`Muff`> np ;0
[09 Jan/19:11] <Ptt> man.. what am I going to do with all the cdrw that I bought.
[09 Jan/19:11] <CJ^> ok
[09 Jan/19:11] <CJ^> so have ya looked int eh device manager to see if there is a conflict??
[09 Jan/19:11] <LosGuy> vader any what exactly happened during  install?

But, I want it so that unless either my wife or I enter the correct username and password, no one else can get into the system... Can that be done?
[09 Jan/20:02] <LosGuy> set a bios password
[09 Jan/20:02] <LosGuy> or...
[09 Jan/20:02] <SidTrips> Or, do I need NT for that kind of security?

[09 Jan/20:02] <SidTrips> The BIOS password would not be specific to the user...

[09 Jan/20:11] <LosGuy> some nics dont like to share IRQs and require busmastering 
[09 Jan/20:11] <LosGuy> you might make sure one of them is in pci slot one and the other is in slot 2
[09 Jan/20:12] <LosGuy> (slot one will have busmastering but you will need to check your mb manual about the others)
[09 Jan/20:12] <DMann> in resources it has I/O and memory range but no interupt

[09 Jan/20:39] <LosGuy> mIRC just install another instance of it
[09 Jan/20:39] <LosGuy> or copy your current one
[09 Jan/20:40] <LosGuy> to another folder and then set it up
[09 Jan/20:40] <LosGuy> re ICQ I dunno
[09 Jan/20:40] <SidTrips> And have her link to that one instead?
[09 Jan/20:40] <LosGuy> yeah
[09 Jan/20:40] <devilDigg> icq is easy
[09 Jan/20:40] <devilDigg> just register another user, and set security to high..
[09 Jan/20:40] * LosGuy dont do ICQ
[09 Jan/20:41] <SidTrips> Hrm...  Unbelievable there is not a more organized way to do this, with as many multi-ser families in existance...
[09 Jan/20:41] <devilDigg> then when you want to change the user, just go to :

[09 Jan/20:44] <LosGuy> well a good linux sys admin makes more than a good NT admin
[09 Jan/20:44] <devilDigg> oh my god
[09 Jan/20:44] <LosGuy> err I should say UNIX
[09 Jan/20:44] <devilDigg> im wrong!
[09 Jan/20:44] <devilDigg> oh ok.. unix not linux
[09 Jan/20:44] <devilDigg> but a nt admin, makes more than a LINUX admin?
[09 Jan/20:44] <LosGuy> UNIX is harder
[09 Jan/20:44] <devilDigg> i know..
[09 Jan/20:44] <LosGuy> hehe no... linux is a flavor of unix basicly
[09 Jan/20:45] <devilDigg> and its a he** of a lot harder to crash then windows
[09 Jan/20:45] <LosGuy> hmmm I have done it :P
[09 Jan/20:45] <LosGuy> in fact  Xwindows can do it regularly hehe

[09 Jan/20:46] <LosGuy> :P
[09 Jan/20:46] <LosGuy> a good unix admin... makes quite a lot more than a NT admin in fact last I heard

[10 Jan/09:28] <g0> how about se?
[10 Jan/09:28] <CJ^> NT4 has no trouble with it... Win2k will
[10 Jan/09:28] <g0> like what?
[10 Jan/09:28] <CJ^> Se will be the same as 98 actually...
[10 Jan/09:28] <g0> what kind of problems?
[10 Jan/09:28] <g0> cool
[10 Jan/09:29] <g0> maybe i'll just go se

[10 Jan/09:45] <Raph2000> DO they use some kind of Username/password in the background ?
[10 Jan/09:45] <CJ^> no
[10 Jan/09:45] <Raph2000> cause you can't do that in NT4

[10 Jan/12:21] <adamDORK> can i set up 2 window setups on one hard drive?? like make a drive c and d ???
[10 Jan/12:21] <adamDORK> yeah...i no that...i wanna be able to have windows as a seperate install on each drive
[10 Jan/12:21] <LosGuy> you should have only one active primary partition
[10 Jan/12:22] <adamDORK> ?
[10 Jan/12:22] <LosGuy> use something like partition magic  to hide the other drive or a boot manager
[10 Jan/12:22] <adamDORK> so i cant do it on 1 hd?
[10 Jan/12:22] * MaDkOw is Away: [el bisone's hizzouze] + (Page:On)(Log:On)

[10 Jan/12:22] <LosGuy> I do
[10 Jan/12:22] <adamDORK> mmmm
[10 Jan/12:22] <LosGuy> I have 3 windows installs and linux on the same HD
[10 Jan/12:22] <adamDORK> cause i want to b able to fdisk c and have windows on d
[10 Jan/12:23] <LosGuy> but D: is just a partition?
[10 Jan/12:23] <adamDORK> yeah
[10 Jan/12:23] <adamDORK> on 1 hd
[10 Jan/12:23] ! HigHBabE is known as HigH-AwaY
[10 Jan/12:23] <LosGuy> anyway if you do the install on D: windows will still write to C: for some things
[10 Jan/12:23] <adamDORK> so i cant double install windows
[10 Jan/12:23] <adamDORK> damm windows
[10 Jan/12:23] <LosGuy> you will have problems if you do 
[10 Jan/12:23] <adamDORK> yeah

[10 Jan/13:58] <CJ^> shoot
[10 Jan/13:58] <Raph2000> I want to buy a new HardDrive, I have the Choice between 5400 7200, is the last one really faster , can you see it ?
[10 Jan/13:59] <Raph2000> rpm I mean.
[10 Jan/13:59] <mrgone> ahgu just got kicked out of a chan im on from efnet
[10 Jan/13:59] <CJ^> the 7200 rpm drives are nice

[10 Jan/14:00] <CJ^> access wise..a bit  yes
[10 Jan/14:00] <CJ^> but it doesnt beat scsi...
[10 Jan/14:00] <CJ^> still the same BUS speed...
[10 Jan/14:00] <Raph2000> ok, now, I have the choice with 33 or 66, my question is :
[10 Jan/14:00] <mrgone> ah...ahh....ahh    chooooo
[10 Jan/14:01] <Raph2000> My Motherboard takes only 33 right now, is it worth buying a PCI controller card to go up to 66 ?
[10 Jan/14:01] <CJ^> up to you really...
[10 Jan/14:01] <mrgone> i ditched buying a 17 gig fujitsu 33 for a quantum 13 gig 66 for the same price...cause i want all speed
[10 Jan/14:01] <CJ^> i dont see it 
[10 Jan/14:01] <CJ^> id go SCSI..

[10 Jan/14:03] <CJ^> nope...
[10 Jan/14:03] <CJ^> least not that ive seen yet
[10 Jan/14:04] <Raph2000> so, it's a good compromise to buy the PCI Controller to go '66' instead of 33 ?
[10 Jan/14:04] <CJ^> possiblly..
[10 Jan/14:04] <CJ^> or a new mb that supports it...
[10 Jan/14:04] > Vulcan!itsnotme@the.best.os.is.linux.am has joined #win98
[10 Jan/14:05] <Raph2000> that's the chipset which is 33 UDMA or something else ?

[10 Jan/14:05] <CJ^> Intel TX or above is UDMA 33

[10 Jan/14:06] <CJ^> Abit has a mb with a UDMA 66 controller on board...
[10 Jan/14:06] <CJ^> VIA has newer chipsets that support UDMA 66
[10 Jan/14:06] <CJ^> mostly on the K7 boards from what ive seen

[10 Jan/14:07] ! Herb is known as LoCaL_GoD
[10 Jan/14:07] <Raph2000> ok, I understand that I need a 'special' cable for a 66 ( don't know why but..) can I still use a 33UDMA Mb with a 66 HD ?
[10 Jan/14:07] <mrgone> yes you can
[10 Jan/14:07] <Raph2000> whith a regular cable ?
[10 Jan/14:08] <mrgone> and the way i see it, if you dont get a cable now, its a cheap upgrade when you want more speed
[10 Jan/14:08] <mrgone> i think theres 2 cable connectors on the drive isnt there? one 80 pin ul66 and one ide?
[10 Jan/14:09] <Raph2000> I don't know..I didn't buy it yet.
[10 Jan/14:09] <Raph2000> but I'm thinking about it...cause i need space... ;-)

[10 Jan/16:16] <LosGuy> hi
[10 Jan/16:16] <TheNerm> Can I upgrade from win98 to win98 SE in order to obtain only NAT1000 ?
[10 Jan/16:17] <LosGuy> why do you say only?
[10 Jan/16:17] <TheNerm> cuz I only need to have the NAT capabalities
[10 Jan/16:17] <LosGuy> there is a 20 dollar upgrade that includes ICS 
[10 Jan/16:18] <LosGuy> but also patches etc
[10 Jan/16:18] <LosGuy> or try another NAT ie winroute or sygate
[10 Jan/16:18] <CJ^> or spend a little more and get a NAT
[10 Jan/16:18] <CJ^> instead of the upgrade
[10 Jan/16:18] <TheNerm> Losguy: already done, my last try is to upgrade to NAT 1000 =) trust me I tried
[10 Jan/16:20] <TheNerm> but let say I have the CD for win98 SE and I have win98 1st édition installed on my computer, in order to obtain only NAT1000 ( wich is include in win98 SE ) do I have to wipeout my HD and reinstall or could I only upgrade.. thats the realquestion here

[10 Jan/17:24] <R-Hamilto> the screen is just black
[10 Jan/17:24] <Kind-Bud> can anyone tell me why Windows 98 is such a piece of shit......I upgraded from a P-233MMX to a PIII 500 and the performance is basically the same.  With applications that is.  However, Windows 2000 Server runs about 1000 times faster and better......what can i do with Win98?  I really do want to keep it on my machine......any suggestions?
[10 Jan/17:25] <CJ^> ok
[10 Jan/17:25] <CJ^> first
[10 Jan/17:25] <CJ^> dony cuss
[10 Jan/17:25] <Azmodan> Kind-Bud, first of all you can watch yer language
[10 Jan/17:25] <CJ^> and win2k and win98 cannot be compared
[10 Jan/17:25] <CJ^> NT and win9x are two differnt beasts
[10 Jan/17:25] <Kind-Bud> NT = the bigger beast
[10 Jan/17:26] <CJ^> still its a different OS can connot be compared to 98
[10 Jan/17:26] <CJ^> first check for all the apps your loading as ya boot up
[10 Jan/17:26] <CJ^> get rid of them if they aren absolutly needed
[10 Jan/17:27] <CJ^> secondly...  you didnt say how much ram you have inteh new system...
[10 Jan/17:27] <CJ^> or what vid yer running...
[10 Jan/17:27] <Kind-Bud> yeah, i've done a lot of those little tweaks and sh*t but it still doesn't seem to work
[10 Jan/17:27] <CJ^> or the specs on the total system.. that would help...
[10 Jan/17:27] <Kind-Bud> i have a ATI All-In-Wonder 128 AGP (Rage 128 chip)

[11 Jan/18:45] <wez> and <i>I</i> hate <b>you</B>
[11 Jan/18:45] <CJ^> get them outta the autoexec.bat and config.sys
[11 Jan/18:45] <CJ^> and  no cussing

[11 Jan/18:45] <beaker23> so any ideas?
[11 Jan/18:45] <MrServ0n> cj? hmm lemme have a look
[11 Jan/18:45] <beaker23> i guess it would be load sharing in a way
[11 Jan/18:45] <CJ^> beaker... might wanna try sygate
[11 Jan/18:45] <beaker23> anything like wingate?
[11 Jan/18:45] <LosGuy> or winroute and map port21
[11 Jan/18:45] <kcjones> could someone tell give me some tips on making my com run smoother/faster?
[11 Jan/18:45] <beaker23> hmmm, may do it as wingate has no options i can see for that
[11 Jan/18:45] <MrServ0n> Ok i just went to edit my autoexec.bat. and umm its not there..
[11 Jan/18:45] <LosGuy> I dont know if winroute will do it either
[11 Jan/18:46] <CJ^> MrServ  then when during boot up are you getting the errror msg?
[11 Jan/18:46] <beaker23> well i gotta try anyway , i have 2 nics and 2 ips, and wanna use both at th same time

[11 Jan/18:46] <MrServ0n> yea as soon as windows loads i get SB16 DRIVER ALERT
[11 Jan/18:47] <pyrokiwi> how many pcs?
[11 Jan/18:47] <beaker23> 1pc
[11 Jan/18:47] <beaker23> thats the problem
[11 Jan/18:47] <CJ^> MrServ  thats the DOS driver its looking for...
[11 Jan/18:47] <pyrokiwi> hmmmm
[11 Jan/18:47] <CJ^> persoanlly  i removed the SB card..
[11 Jan/18:47] <CJ^> and reinstalled..
[11 Jan/18:47] <CJ^> chosing custom install on the drivers..
[11 Jan/18:47] <pyrokiwi> y u want both though if ya have cable y do u need dialup?
[11 Jan/18:47] <MrServ0n> So what do i do re-install the software and drivers?
[11 Jan/18:47] <CJ^> and not install teh DOS mode drivers..
[11 Jan/18:47] <LosGuy> he may have a conflict

[11 Jan/19:14] <MrServ0n> i found my MB book..
[11 Jan/19:14] <LosGuy> it might be a jumper
[11 Jan/19:14] <MrServ0n> im looking through it
[11 Jan/19:15] <CJ^> some of them disable the sound automatically by removing a ribbon attached to the board...
[11 Jan/19:15] <CJ^> do you have one like that?
[11 Jan/19:19] <MrServ0n> I did remove the ribbon, put it this way, I know the sound blaster live value is working because all the software works for it if i use sound blaster live's .mp3 player it works fine, or anything associated with thier toolbar, anything else is fuzzy. and i still get the CMI SB16 driver alert.. it must be something in the configuration 
[11 Jan/19:19] ! LosGuy is known as LosBrb
[11 Jan/19:19] <MrServ0n> i found something in the MB book, says Onboard Sound Selector and shows a pic of it to be diabled must have a jumper on #5, and it doesnt. Problem is I dont have any jumpers laying around, and i cant just pull one off somewhere else on the board :_
[11 Jan/19:25] <LosBrb> get one from an electronics store

[12 Jan/19:55] <Rav3n> I can suggest a couple things?
[12 Jan/19:55] <Cat`Woman> I am thinking that when this idiot had happy 99
[12 Jan/19:55] * Rav3n is dealing with alot of these issues at work
[12 Jan/19:55] <Cat`Woman> he said he deleted a few things
[12 Jan/19:55] * LosGuy also knows of problems with AOL and dialup
[12 Jan/19:55] <Cat`Woman> and it hasn't worked since
[12 Jan/19:55] <Cat`Woman> sure rav3n...shoot
[12 Jan/19:55] <Deton8R> yeah...aol IS a dialup problem
[12 Jan/19:55] <CJ^> sounds lke a just plain jane  AOL mess up
[12 Jan/19:56] <Deton8R> hehe
[12 Jan/19:56] <Rav3n> ok if we think we've got Happy99 check for the *.ska files 
[12 Jan/19:56] ! Not^Here is known as grunter
[12 Jan/19:56] <Cat`Woman> not just aol... I put my own dialup on there too
[12 Jan/19:56] <Azmodan> proxy settings?

[12 Jan/19:56] <LosGuy> replace wsock32.dll
[12 Jan/19:56] <CJ^>  but AOL does mess with teh system..
[12 Jan/19:56] <Deton8R> wonder if he ever got happy99 off there 
[12 Jan/19:56] <CJ^> but  no wories right now
[12 Jan/19:56] <Rav3n> if they're there delete c:\windows\system\wsock32.dll and wsock32.ska anyway oh and ska.dll ska.exe 
[12 Jan/19:56] <Rav3n> just incase 
[12 Jan/19:57] <Cat`Woman> well, he has norton bloatware running now, guess he learned his lessons
[12 Jan/19:57] <Cat`Woman> ok
[12 Jan/19:57] <Rav3n> then what i'd recommend is this
[12 Jan/19:57] <Cat`Woman> I think it is the winsock
[12 Jan/19:57] <Rav3n> go to Start->settings->control Panel->Network delete everything in there after taking down and settings we might need later with aol that shouldnt be anything
[12 Jan/19:58] <Cat`Woman> well...
[12 Jan/19:58] <Cat`Woman> I already have win98 re-installing
[12 Jan/19:58] <CJ^> on top of itself??
[12 Jan/19:58] <Rav3n> then go to 'Safe mode' and Start->Settings->Control Panel-> Add/Remove->Windows setup->communications and remove DUN 
[12 Jan/19:58] <Rav3n> ergh ok
[12 Jan/19:58] <Cat`Woman> yup
[12 Jan/19:58] <Rav3n> if that doesnt work
[12 Jan/19:58] <CJ^> ack
[12 Jan/19:58] <Rav3n> ...
[12 Jan/19:59] <Cat`Woman> Los,,, I hope your logging this
[12 Jan/19:59] <Rav3n> remove stuff in network and remove dial-up networking
[12 Jan/19:59] <Cat`Woman> CJ... why ack?
[12 Jan/19:59] <Cat`Woman> Det said it would work!  ;)
[12 Jan/19:59] <Rav3n> then Start->Run->regedit
[12 Jan/19:59] <CJ^> cause a re-intall NEVER helps
[12 Jan/19:59] <Rav3n> it does occasionally ;p
[12 Jan/19:59] <CJ^> not on top of itself
[12 Jan/20:00] <Cat`Woman> I suppose this is a good topic for tonight then... 
[12 Jan/20:00] <Cat`Woman> ;)
[12 Jan/20:00] <Cat`Woman> maybe we will all learn something...especially me
[12 Jan/20:00] <Cat`Woman> ok, what do we need to do in regedit (when this install doesn't work)
[12 Jan/20:00] <LosGuy> it wont FIX registry problems..but if the problem is file corruption.. it very well may
[12 Jan/20:00] <Rav3n> then HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\services
[12 Jan/20:01] <Rav3n> VxD 
[12 Jan/20:01] <Rav3n> and remove winsock and winsock2
[12 Jan/20:01] <Cat`Woman> ok
[12 Jan/20:02] <Rav3n> then remove the winsock and winsock2 keys in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\services\ 
[12 Jan/20:02] <Rav3n> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\services\VxD\winsock 
[12 Jan/20:02] <Rav3n> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\services\VxD\winsock2
[12 Jan/20:03] <Rav3n> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\services\winsock
[12 Jan/20:03] <Rav3n> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\services\winsock2
[12 Jan/20:03] <Rav3n> those 4 keys

[15 Jan/14:32] <Los-Guy> can try
[15 Jan/14:32] <wahspUnaD> i was cleaning up my system unloading some programs when i got to one (can't remember which) i uninstalled it and when i did it cleared out my whole add/remove list
[15 Jan/14:33] <wahspUnaD> do you know what could have aused this?

[15 Jan/14:34] <Los-Guy> do you have tweakUI installed?
[15 Jan/14:34] <wahspUnaD> i'm listening....
[15 Jan/14:34] <wahspUnaD> yes
[15 Jan/14:35] <Los-Guy> are there items listed there in add remove?
[15 Jan/14:35] <wahspUnaD> nope
[15 Jan/14:35] <Los-Guy> was the culprit norton utils?
[15 Jan/14:36] <wahspUnaD> nope, never had that on my system
[15 Jan/14:36] <Los-Guy> what program did this?
[15 Jan/14:36] <wahspUnaD> i can't remember which program it is, i wish i could, but it uninstalled really quickly then made my list disappear
[15 Jan/14:36] <Los-Guy> couple of things come to mind as posibilties... 
[15 Jan/14:36] <Los-Guy> scanreg /fix
[15 Jan/14:37] <wahspUnaD> in dos right?
[15 Jan/14:37] <wahspUnaD> windows/command directory?
[15 Jan/14:37] <Los-Guy> or restoring a older version of the registry ..but then you will have reg entries from the items you removed and would probably need to run the regcleaner
[15 Jan/14:37] <Los-Guy> uh no its command line
[15 Jan/14:37] <Los-Guy> or you can run msinfo32

[15 Jan/14:59] <Big`Ed> Los-Guy is single
[15 Jan/14:59] <Raph2000> ask melanie.
[15 Jan/14:59] <Melanie> you see, this driver, doing all this annoying problems always close my IE up
[15 Jan/14:59] <Melanie> And it named Et6000.drv
[15 Jan/15:00] <Big`Ed> your on a network?
[15 Jan/15:00] <Melanie> and I think that's because the display driver
[15 Jan/15:00] <Melanie> nopes
[15 Jan/15:00] <Melanie> Win98
[15 Jan/15:00] <Melanie> Hebrew enabled
[15 Jan/15:00] <Big`Ed> i presume that is a video driver
[15 Jan/15:01] <Big`Ed> you would have to reload your video drivers

[15 Jan/15:01] <wahspUnaD> ok, did that, it fixed the problem, thanks to both of you for your help
[15 Jan/15:01] <Los-Guy> np wahspUnaD
[15 Jan/15:01] <wahspUnaD> now where can i find the reg cleaner?
[15 Jan/15:01] <Big`Ed> Melanie - how exactly are you getting the error?
[15 Jan/15:02] <Los-Guy> wahspUnaD it is on ms site or search any shareware site
[15 Jan/15:02] <wahspUnaD> great, thanks
[15 Jan/15:02] <Melanie> I open IE/Photo Shop 5/Ace Expert and it gives me that error
[15 Jan/15:02] <Big`Ed> did you allways have this error or when did it start?
[15 Jan/15:03] <Melanie> ahh, yeah, but sometimes it fixed by itself
[15 Jan/15:04] <Big`Ed> yes - but how long have you been having it?
[15 Jan/15:04] <Melanie> not now, like last time, before i formatted
[15 Jan/15:04] <Melanie> i dunnno.. about a week
[15 Jan/15:04] <Big`Ed> and you have had this problem SINCE you reformated?
[15 Jan/15:04] <Big`Ed> i ask - cuz something is causing it
[15 Jan/15:05] <Melanie> well no, it happend last time as well
[15 Jan/15:05] <Melanie> not as aften tho
[15 Jan/15:05] <Big`Ed> but something you did then, and something you did NOW is causing this problem
[15 Jan/15:06] <Emma_> well
[15 Jan/15:06] <Melanie> I dunno.. last time ace expert worked very good now it won't even come up
[15 Jan/15:06] <Melanie> that driver having all kinda modes
[15 Jan/15:06] <Melanie> working whenever he feels like
[15 Jan/15:06] <Emma_> Big`Ed the problem has been adressed by others online before
[15 Jan/15:06] <Emma_> i did a search on et6000.drv on altavista
[15 Jan/15:07] <Big`Ed> explain Emma_
[15 Jan/15:07] <Emma_> and the same error popped right up on message forums
[15 Jan/15:07] <Melanie> with the same version
[15 Jan/15:07] <Big`Ed> go ahead
[15 Jan/15:07] <Emma_> it didnt help to reinstall what i suggest
[15 Jan/15:07] <Emma_> is that she finds out what kind of display card she has
[15 Jan/15:07] <Emma_> go to their website
[15 Jan/15:07] <Emma_> and download the newest driver
[15 Jan/15:07] <Emma_> and try that instead of using the standard windows drivers

[15 Jan/17:14] <ag1> can someone enlighten me a bit regarding an mprexe error message i was receiving?
[15 Jan/17:14] <Los-Guy> what was the exact error message?
[15 Jan/17:15] <ag1> it wasnt able to detect what themodule was when i clicked on "details"
[15 Jan/17:15] <ag1> i have since sort of corrected the problem, maybe... but am wondering what to do
[15 Jan/17:16] <ag1> i had a backup of my registry from a few days ago and imported it, things seem to work.. but here is when the problem started...
[15 Jan/17:16] <ag1> i installed win2000 on the system to have a dual boot option, then all of a sudden i couldnt do anything in win98... i would get somethinig like  "an unspecified error has occured"  then i'd click ok, then i'd get the mprexe error...
[15 Jan/17:17] > CJ^!~skippy@sdn-ar-001watacoP255.dialsprint.net has joined #win98
[15 Jan/17:17] <Los-Guy> try reinstalling windows98 on top of itself?
[15 Jan/17:17] <ag1> another thing i noticed, prior to reloading the registry, was that i could go out and manually run c:\windows\system\mprexe.exe  adn then i could load things like windows explorer, whereas before i couldnt...
[15 Jan/17:17] <Big`Ed> hahaha
[15 Jan/17:17] <ag1> well, i tried that too... but it didnt work...
[15 Jan/17:18] <Big`Ed> must be nice to have BOUGHT win2000 allready
[15 Jan/17:18] <ag1> no, its RC2
[15 Jan/17:18] <CJ^> ag1....  why ya running it?
[15 Jan/17:18] <ag1> which i get legally...
[15 Jan/17:18] <Big`Ed> so your a legal beta site?
[15 Jan/17:18] <CJ^> specially THAT old of a beta
[15 Jan/17:18] <ag1> you could say that
[15 Jan/17:18] <CJ^> no...
[15 Jan/17:18] <ag1> there only on RC3 now...
[15 Jan/17:18] <CJ^> are ya  or arent ya
[15 Jan/17:18] <ag1> as far as i no
[15 Jan/17:18] <ag1> know
[15 Jan/17:18] <CJ^> ag1  its shipped
[15 Jan/17:19] <CJ^> its final
[15 Jan/17:19] <CJ^> its GOLD...
[15 Jan/17:19] <CJ^> hello..
[15 Jan/17:19] <ag1> cool... i've been too busy to really know that i guess..
[15 Jan/17:19] <ag1> anyway, the RC2 was giving me problems..
[15 Jan/17:19] <ag1> i am loading it on a laptop
[15 Jan/17:20] <Big`Ed> do you have the problem with ONLY clean windows 98 install?
[15 Jan/17:20] <CJ^> too busy to turn on a TV?
[15 Jan/17:20] <CJ^> ahh  nm
[15 Jan/17:20] <ag1> i couldnt get it to load up after the install... then when i take out the pcmcia cards it boots up fine...
[15 Jan/17:21] <ag1> otherwise i get a message something regarding KMODE_....
[15 Jan/17:21] <ag1> i didnt have many problems with win98 before... nothing that bad anyway
[15 Jan/17:21] <ag1> i was about to format the c: partition, and reinstall 98
[15 Jan/17:22] <ag1> i imagine all my stuff on the d and e partitions would be fine even if i format the c, right?
[15 Jan/17:22] <walkndude> right
[15 Jan/17:22] > Free`!~user@cda635.emirates.net.ae has joined #win98
[15 Jan/17:22] <ag1> to answer your question of why i was loading it, one reason was that i wanted NT, 4 would have been fine for me, but unfortunately, due to user error (yeah, thats me) i made the drive FAT32....
[15 Jan/17:23] <ag1> so i was stuck with win2000
[15 Jan/17:23] <Big`Ed> ag1 - mprexe deals mostly with networking
[15 Jan/17:23] <Big`Ed> if you are getting other errors too
[15 Jan/17:23] <Big`Ed> it is indicative of other problems
[15 Jan/17:23] <Free`> hiya ...... my computer running with win98 wont go on power standby ..... keeps saying some device is wrong ..... is there an easy fix ?
[15 Jan/17:23] <Big`Ed> ag1 - also we do NOT support WAREZ - NON win98 problems
[15 Jan/17:24] <Big`Ed> Free` - what device is wrong?
[15 Jan/17:24] <walkndude> http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q178/0/84.asp?LNG=ENG&SA=ALLKB
[15 Jan/17:24] <Big`Ed> Free` - you have lots of devices
[15 Jan/17:24] <walkndude> that may or may not help?
[15 Jan/17:25] <Big`Ed> good link walkndude - closes thing
[15 Jan/17:25] <Free`> Big`Ed - heh heh ..... i wish it said ..... i remember a while back though i was told to run a win98 config program and turn a setting back on .. after which it worked fine
[15 Jan/17:25] <ag1> Big`Ed its is/was a win98 problem, as far as i could tell, but i am a little skeptical, since it only occured after installing win2000
[15 Jan/17:26] <Big`Ed> correct 
[15 Jan/17:26] <Big`Ed> that problem was very prevelent in 95 days
[15 Jan/17:26] <Big`Ed> and is almost non-existent in 98 
[15 Jan/17:26] <ag1> which one?
[15 Jan/17:26] <Big`Ed> perhaps if you get your system back to a LEGAL win98 configuration - we can help you farther
[15 Jan/17:27] <Free`> Big`Ed - problem is i don't remember what it was i ran to fix it last time
[15 Jan/17:27] <ag1> well it is now.. i would say
[15 Jan/17:27] <ag1> i mean, things are working now....
[15 Jan/17:27] <Big`Ed> Free` - msconfig
[15 Jan/17:27] <ag1> though i havent tried rebooting to see if win2K would load
[15 Jan/17:27] <Big`Ed> ag1 - ok - things are working - whats the problem?
[15 Jan/17:28] <Big`Ed> no warez (warning 2)
[15 Jan/17:28] <Free`> Big`Ed - woooooooo ........ that was simple ....... thanks a million :)

[15 Jan/17:28] <ag1> big`ed are you saying that to me?

[15 Jan/17:29] <ag1> i never asked a non win98 question!
[15 Jan/17:29] <CJ^> win2k  is not in stores...
[15 Jan/17:29] <Big`Ed> yes  = your using a old version of beta network OS mixed with a released desktop os.   Second, see the link that walkndude sent you
[15 Jan/17:29] <CJ^> talkign about it technically breaks the NDA
[15 Jan/17:29] <ag1> and what does WAREZ mean anyway?
[15 Jan/17:30] <CJ^> stolen software
[15 Jan/17:30] <walkndude> ZZzzz
[15 Jan/17:30] <ag1> excuse the ignorance...
[15 Jan/17:30] <Big`Ed> all problems caused by using your legal beta software is supported by microsoft for free as part of the beta program.
[15 Jan/17:30] <CJ^> thats what it means
[15 Jan/17:31] <ag1> well, it is legal beta software then... my company has a partnership with microsoft, we get many of their products to run, and i am running it on a company laptop...
[15 Jan/17:31] <CJ^> and...  to tell the truth  if you are a beta tester... you would be aware that it has shipped.. cause you would have teh RC3 or final by now...
[15 Jan/17:31] <CJ^> ag1  your company does...
[15 Jan/17:31] <CJ^> its to be used at the company... as per the agreement..
[15 Jan/17:31] <ag1> well, i am travelling and havent been in the office in quite a while...
[15 Jan/17:31] <Big`Ed> ag1 - just cuz your COMPANY tossed the CD to you like a fresbee don't make your installation of it legal.
[15 Jan/17:32] <ag1> exactly, and since i am travelling and using company hardware (though as far as i understand i am also allowed to run it on my home pc if i wish..) its all legal
[15 Jan/17:32] <walkndude> what strike we on now 2 or 3 ?
[15 Jan/17:32] <CJ^> no ag1  its not...
[15 Jan/17:32] <Azmodan> I think we just made it to strike 5
[15 Jan/17:32] <Big`Ed> better go back and READ the license on what you installed then
[15 Jan/17:32] <CJ^> the company admins shudl have told you this...
[15 Jan/17:32] <ag1> what isnt legal about it?
[15 Jan/17:32] <CJ^> i really hope your not an IT pro...

[15 Jan/17:33] <Big`Ed> (wonder where it said free to use on home pc's too)
[15 Jan/17:33] <Big`Ed> i gotta get that EULA
[15 Jan/17:33] <CJ^> actually.....
[15 Jan/17:33] <CJ^> only MS internals.. and a few companies were allowed to do that Ed..
[15 Jan/17:33] <CJ^> Like Compaq and what have ya....
[15 Jan/17:34] <Big`Ed> but he just has that MSDN thing
[15 Jan/17:34] <CJ^> right
[15 Jan/17:34] <CJ^> and thats NOT legal...
[15 Jan/17:35] <CJ^> the EULA with MSDN does allow it to beinstalled on as many test systems that are logged to MS...
[15 Jan/17:35] <Big`Ed> [20:30] *ag1* well, I'd at least like to say thank you for the assistance you did provide me with. As far as I know there is nothing illegal about what i am doing, but i will verify this. Its a shame that many of the people in the channel dont have the patience or openmindedness to at least consider that I may be correct.... at least i will verify what i say is true, i doubt anyone there knows for 100% sure that I am doing something illegal. thanks, and
[15 Jan/17:35] <Big`Ed> right - logged to msdn
[15 Jan/17:35] <CJ^> yeap
[15 Jan/17:35] <Big`Ed> not any pc
[15 Jan/17:35] <CJ^> all the systems that have it installed become part of the BUG report DB
[15 Jan/17:35] <Big`Ed> it also talks about the support (actually lack off) on the beta
[15 Jan/17:36] <CJ^> hehe
[15 Jan/17:36] <CJ^> support is provided by email...
[15 Jan/17:36] <CJ^> except ot priority customers with showstopper bugs
[15 Jan/17:37] <CJ^> IE: COmpaq with a 36 proc Alpha...
[15 Jan/17:37] <Big`Ed> my latest beta software from microsoft has a 3 page license NDA
[15 Jan/17:37] <CJ^> hehe
[15 Jan/17:37] <CJ^> reall..
[15 Jan/17:37] <CJ^> didnt think testing the MSN IM was that hard though...
[15 Jan/17:37] <CJ^> BoB 2.3

[15 Jan/18:16] <F0o> so is mine normale, today it started doing strange things, my cd-r/cd-rw went west, for some reason could've been because I deltree C:\windows\sysbckup (thinking that directory wasn't needed "it is back up") :)

[15 Jan/18:17] <Los-Guy> doesnt sound normal to me if your doing deltree on windows files
[15 Jan/18:18] <F0o> well it bckup, which I asume is a back up, there for it should've be access cd drivers in a backup directory, but in C:\windows\system(32) etc

[15 Jan/19:31] <CJ^> and set teh modem to com3 irq 4..
[15 Jan/19:31] <CJ^> just to avoide the sound card conflict

[16 Jan/17:34] <SenecaQ> My new PC with Win98SE will not shut down automatically despite downloding the fix from MS. Any ideas
[16 Jan/17:35] <Los`Guy> update your drivers
[16 Jan/17:35] <Los`Guy> the usual cause is a driver failing to unload
[16 Jan/17:35] <CJ^> or contact the maker of the PC....
[16 Jan/17:35] <Los`Guy> also check any programs that your running as TSR (ie your antivirus scanner)
[16 Jan/17:36] <SenecaQ> Which ones? PC is brand ne clone. All the Windows updtaes.
[16 Jan/17:36] <Los`Guy> I would start with my vid driver SenecaQ and go from there
[16 Jan/17:36] <SenecaQ> Even if I close all programs running in the background (except explorer and systray) it still does not shut down.
[16 Jan/17:37] <SenecaQ> Aha! Video driver, eh?
[16 Jan/17:37] <Los`Guy> I would try that first SenecaQ
[16 Jan/17:38] <Los`Guy> but heck if it is a new computer..I would take it back (As CJ^ said)
[16 Jan/17:38] <CJ^> yeap..
[16 Jan/17:39] <CJ^> but $100 says they tell you the same thing....  update teh drivers dude..

[17 Jan/19:01] <devAway> i dont think it can be done, thats how win2k and o2k are.. but i would check the prefs
[17 Jan/19:01] <devAway> and your office helper
[17 Jan/19:02] <JMG> Unfortunately tried those already with no help
[17 Jan/19:03] <devAway> then like i said before you cant, its the same in windows 2000, thats how microsoft thought it looked best, guess you will have to settle with that :(
[17 Jan/19:03] <devAway> but i'd keep lookin though
[17 Jan/19:03] <devAway> like on their site..
[17 Jan/19:03] <devAway> and public msg boards
[17 Jan/19:03] <devAway> and right here on irc
[17 Jan/19:04] <Los`Guy> try the KB and deja.com
[17 Jan/19:05] <JMG> ok, I'll take a look, got to be a registry setting somewhere that conrols them.

[17 Jan/19:13] <Nightfox> Hello
[17 Jan/19:13] <Nightfox> I'm running Windows 98 Second Edition.  I have a PnP monitor that's capable of 1280x1024.  Windows used to be able to use this resolution, but since I re-installed Windows not too long ago, it no longer has a 1280x1024 option in the display settings..  I've tried having it re-detect the monitor, and I also tried manually changing the monitor in Windows's setup, but it didn't help..  Anyone have any ideas?

[18 Jan/18:06] <LosGuy> hy devilDigg
[18 Jan/18:07] <Bill_> I just bought another hard drive, and would like to move my data files to it (my documents, favorites, outlook, etc.). Does anyone know if this is possible?
[18 Jan/18:09] <LosGuy> yes Bill_
[18 Jan/18:09] <LosGuy> you can slave the drive 
[18 Jan/18:09] <LosGuy> and then just copy it using explorer for data files
[18 Jan/18:09] <Bill_> Do I need to make registry changes?
[18 Jan/18:09] <Bill_> I want d: to be the default for any data files
[18 Jan/18:10] <LosGuy> or use xcopy from a dos prompt if you like (switches can be found by typing xcopy /?)
[18 Jan/18:10] <LosGuy> Bill_ you should not need to make any registry changes if your just copying data
[18 Jan/18:10] <LosGuy> however you will have problems if you try to copy most programs
[18 Jan/18:10] <Bill_> How do I move Favorites?

[18 Jan/18:11] <Deton8R> but we're workin on him
[18 Jan/18:11] <Bill_> Basically programs only on C:, Data files on D:
[18 Jan/18:11] <LosGuy> if you have another on another drive.. that is different
[18 Jan/18:11] <LosGuy> Bill_ desktop FILES are located at c:\windows\desktop
[18 Jan/18:12] <Bill_> unless you have more than one user set up..., but I'd like to move desktop to the other drive. Do you know if that's even possible?

[19 Jan/17:18] <LosGuy> you will not be happy with the results if you do
